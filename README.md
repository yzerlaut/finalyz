# A template for scientific papers

_A plain text (.txt)-based framework to efficiently report scientific analysis._

What this software enables is to:
- Provide a datafile (e.g. a python dictionary file "data.npz") and have your numerical values exported automatically within the text (no need to manually copy-paste the analysis output)
- Export your analysis to the document format that best fits your audience !
   - either short reports with two columns
   - either long and detailed reports in the single column 
   - either to pre-defined templates of scientific journals: PloS journals, Springer journals, Physical Review journals, Cell journals, J. Neurosci., etc ...
- Benefit from the the Emacs editing capabilities because the txt template uses the Org-Mode syntax.
