* Abstract

The processing of sensory input in awake animals lies on top of strong behaviorally-relevant modulations in the collective dynamics of cortical networks. Understanding cortical function during wakefulness would therefore largely benefit from a measure of network states relying on the most commonly acquired electrophysiological signal: the extracellular potential. We introduce here a Network State Index (NSI) giving a quantitative formulation to the “U-model" of arousal in sensory cortices from this population signal. We use simultaneous extracellular and intracellular recordings in the somato-sensory cortex of awake mice to design and calibrate a method gradually classifying network states from low frequency (2-10Hz) activity to asynchronous activity at various spiking activity levels. We use this measure to analyze the link between single-cell (intracellular) and population (extracellular) signals over the different network regimes of wakefulness. We find that the graded levels of population signal during non-rhythmic activity is faithfully translated into the single cell depolarization levels. On the other hand, the graded levels of rhythmic population signals translate in a rather stereotypical oscillatory pattern of membrane potential. Finally, we show that the variability of network states, beyond the occurrence of slow synchronous activity, critically contribute to the average correlations between single cell and population signals in neocortex.

* Introduction

During wakefulness, epochs corresponding to various levels of physiological and behavioral markers (such as pupil size, whisking, locomotion, hippocampal ripples rate, ...) have been correlated with various membrane potential ($V_m$) signatures in rodent cortices (Constantinople and Bruno 2011; Einstein et al. 2017; Poulet and Petersen 2008; Okun et al. 2010; Polack et al. 2013; McGinley et al. 2015a; Reimer et al. 2014; Schneider et al. 2014). Those observations evidenced the existence of various network states during wakefulness (McGinley et al. 2015b; Busse et al. 2017). An emergent conceptual picture for the modulation of network activity in sensory cortices is the "U-model" of arousal (McGinley et al. 2015b): a continuum of network states including three well-identified patterns of $V_m$ fluctuations. At low arousal levels (quantified by a low pupil diameter and the absence of motor behavior), the membrane potential fluctuations exhibit a stereotypical [2,10]Hz oscillatory pattern (Crochet and Petersen 2006; Poulet and Petersen 2008; McGinley et al. 2015a; Reimer et al. 2014). At moderate arousal (quantified by an intermediate pupil diameter), single cells are hyperpolarized and display low amplitude $V_m$ fluctuations (McGinley et al. 2015a; Reimer et al. 2014). At high arousal levels (under motor behavior or and/or high pupil dilatation), the membrane potential exhibits a sustained depolarization with high-frequency $V_m$ fluctuations and high firing activity (Crochet and Petersen 2006; Poulet and Petersen 2008; Polack et al. 2013; McGinley et al. 2015a; Reimer et al. 2014; Vinck et al. 2015). What is the correlate of such network states in terms of extracellular potential in neocortex? How does the $V_m$-defined graded aspect of this diversity of states translate into extracellular signals ? Can one derive a robust classification of for network states from the extracellular potential ? By combining intra- and extracellular recordings in awake mice somato-sensory cortex, we addressed those questions in the present study.

# In the present study, we combined intra- and extracellular recordings in awake mice somato-sensory cortex to analyze how this diversity of network states (measured in terms of $V_m$ fluctuations) translate into extracellular signals. We introduced a Network State Index (NSI) and, using such a measure, we found that the fluctuations of the extracellular high-gamma power enabled a robust classification of network states mapping the predictions of intracellular signals. We finally analyzed how the distribution of network states within a recording period shaped the average correlations between the single cell (intracellular) and population (extracellular) signals. We found that the variability of network states, beyond the occurrence of slow synchronous activity, is the main factor shaping the average correlations between single cell and population signals in neocortex.

* Materials and Methods

*** Animals 

Experimental procedures involving animals have been approved by the IIT Animal Welfare Body and by the Italian Ministry of Health (authorization \# 34/2015-PR and 125/2012-B), in accordance with the National legislation (D.Lgs. 26/2014) and the European legislation (European Directive 2010/63/EU). Experiments were performed on young-adult (4-6 weeks old, either sex) C57BL/6J mice (Charles River, Calco, Italy). The animals were housed in a 12:12 hr light-dark cycle in singularly ventilated cages, with access to food and water ad libitum.

*** Simultaneous extra- and intracellular recordings in awake mice

The experimental procedure for in vivo electrophysiological recordings in awake head-fixed mice have been previously described (Zucca et al. 2017). Briefly, custom metal plate were fixed on young (P22-P24) mice skull two weeks before the experimental sessions. After a 2-3 days recovery period, mice were habituated to sit quietly on the experimental setup for at least 7-10 days (one session per day and gradually increasing session duration). The day of the experiment, mice were anesthetized with 2.5\% isofluorane and a small craniotomy (0.5x0.5 mm) was opened over the somatosensory cortex and a 30 minutes long recovery period was provided to the animal before starting the recordings. Brain surface was kept moist with a HEPES-buffered artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). Extracellular recordings were performed by lowering a glass pipette filled with aCSF into the tissue with the deeper tip placed at $\sim$300 mm from pial surface. Simultaneous current-clamp patch-clamp recordings were carried out on superficial pyramidal neurons (100– 350 mm). 3–6 M$\Omega$ borosilicate glass pipettes (Hilgenberg, Malsfeld, Germany) were filled with an internal solution containing (in mM): K-gluconate 140, MgCl2 1, NaCl 8, Na2ATP 2, Na3GTP 0.5, HEPES 10, Tris-phosphocreatine 10 to pH 7.2 with KOH. Electrical signals were acquired using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier, filtered at 10 kHz, digitized at 50 kHz with a Digidata 1440 and stored with pClamp 10 (RRID:SCR\_011323, Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). 

*** Wavelet Transform

Our signal processing pipeline of the extracellular signal was based on the wavelet transform. We implemented a wavelet transform based on the Morlet wavelet, i.e. on the waveform:

\begin{equation}
M_{d_0}(f, t) = C_{d_0}(f) \cdot e^{2 i \pi f t} \cdot e^{-\big(\frac{\sqrt{2} \pi f t}{d_0}\big)^2}
\label{eq:Morlet}
\end{equation}
where $f$ is the frequency of the wavelet and $d_0$ the decay parameter of the envelope. We kept a value of $d_0$=6 all along the study. The coefficient $C_{f, d_0}$ is the normalization coefficient of the wavelet. Note that, to keep a meaningful link with the physical units of the signal, we did not normalize the wavelet with respect to itself, but with respect to a sinusoid (otherwise the wavelet transform with standard normalization of a sinusoid of frequency $f$ and amplitude 1 has a value greater than 1 at the frequency $f$). The wavelet normalization coefficient was therefore defined, for a wavelet frequency $f$ and an extent $d_0$, as:

\begin{equation}
C_{d_0}(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \cos (2 \pi f s) \cdot \overline{M_{d_0}(f, s)} \cdot ds = 
\frac{d_0}{2 \sqrt{2 \pi } f} \Big( 1 + e^{\frac{(d_0)^2}{2}} \Big)
\end{equation}

The transform was implemented by a convolution between the complex conjuguate of the Morlet wavelet (Equation {Morlet}) and the signal $S(t)$, i.e.:

\begin{equation}
W(f, t) = \int_{-T_f}^{T_f} \Big( S(t-s)- \langle S \rangle_{t,T_f}  \Big) \cdot \overline{M_{d_0}(f, s)} \, ds
\label{eq:wavelet-transform}
\end{equation}

where $\langle S \rangle_{t,T_f}$ is the signal average in the window centered at $t$ of extent $T_f$. $T_f$ is the frequency-dependent window on which the convolution is performed, it was defined as the extent of the wavelet where its amplitude decays by $(1-e^{-4})$=98.2\%, i.e. $T_f=\sqrt{2} \frac{d_0}{\pi \, f}$. From Equation {wavelet-transform}, we computed the power and the phase at time $t$ of a given frequency $f$ in the signal by taking the norm and argument of the complex number $W(f, t)$.

*** Computing the pLFP signal

We consider a frequency band spanning [$f_0/w_0$, $f_0 \cdot w_0$], where $f_0$ is a root frequency and $w_0$ the width parameter of the band. We take a set of $N$={wavelet_number} wavelets uniformly spanning this band (i.e. evenly space from $f_0/w_0$ to $f_0 \cdot w_0$). The pLFP signal consists in the sum over $N$ of the $k$ wavelet powers of frequency $f_k \in [f_0/w_0, f_0 \cdot w_0]$, i.e.:

\begin{equation}
\textrm{pLFP}(t) = \sum_{k \in [1,N]} \frac{\| W(f_k, t) \|}{N}
\label{eq:pLFP}
\end{equation}

This time-varying signal is then smoothed over time with a Gaussian filter to yield the final pLFP signal (see Figure {pLFP}a).

*** Computing the Network State Index (NSI)

To improve the method's computational efficiency, the smoothed pLFP signal is subsampled in bins of {pLFP_subsampling}ms (keeping the 50kHz sampling of electrophysiological signals is unnecessary given the much slower time scale of state transitions, see Results). 
We compute the distribution of the pLFP signal over the whole recording and we extract the lower bound of the pLFP signal $p_0$ by taking the value of the lowest $p_0^{frac}$=1\% fraction of the distribution. We interpret this recording-specific $p_0$ value as the residual high-gamma power in absence of neural activity (see the systematic depolarization from the activity at pLFP$\leq p_0$ in Figure {NSI}f) and we will therefore this value as an estimate of the noise level in the pLFP signal.

We then compute the time-varying power of the [2,10]Hz band $Pow^{max}_{[2,10]Hz}$ of the pLFP signal thanks to the above wavelet transform (Equation {wavelet-transform}). We take a set of 20 wavelets uniformly sampling the [2,10]Hz band and, at every {pLFP_subsampling}ms time point, we extract the maximum power from this band (and the phase of this maximum power in Figure {NSI}f). We construct a weighted estimate $X(t)$ of the low-frequency content of the pLFP signal by  $X(t) = p_0 + \alpha Pow^{max}_{[2,10]Hz}$, where $\alpha$ is the threshold parameter for the rhythmic/non-rhythmic classification (see Results). We also compute a slow average of the pLFP fluctuations with a Gaussian smoothing of time constant $T_{mean}$={T_sliding_mean}ms, yielding the signal $Y(t)$. Finally, the Network State Index (NSI) is given by the formula:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:NSI}
\textrm{NSI}(t) = - 2 \cdot Pow^{max}_{[2,10]Hz} \cdot \mathcal{H}(X-Y) + (Y-p_0) \cdot \mathcal{H}(Y-X)
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{H}$ is the Heaviside function (i.e. step function).

From this time-varying signal, we compute the "validated" network states by running through the time axis in steps of $T_{state}$/2={Tstate_update}ms and checking that the $T_{state}$={Tstate}ms window surrounding each time point does not contain variations of the NSI signal larger that a threshold $p_{fluct}^{thre}$. For the value of the $p_{fluct}^{thre}$ threshold, we took our estimate of the noise level, i.e. the $p_0$ value.

The signal processing steps of this procedure are illustrated on Figure {NSI}a and all parameters of the analysis are summarized in Table {params}.

*** Data Analysis and Statistics

Data were analyzed with \texttt{SciPy} (Oliphant 2007). The signal processing steps (filtering, convolution, subsampling, ...) were implemented in \texttt{numpy}. Statistics was performed with the \texttt{scipy.stats} module (t-tests, Pearson correlations). Multiple linear regressions were performed with the \texttt{OLS} (ordinary least squares) function of the \texttt{statsmodel} module. Experimental data were translated to Python using the \texttt{neo} module (Garcia et al. 2014, RRID:SCR\_000634). 

*** Software implementation

We implemented the described analysis into a publicly available software, see \url{https://github.com/yzerlaut/Waking_State_Index}. The software contains the described algorithm, a graphical user interface and the support to a few electrophysiological data formats.

(a) Example simultaneous recording of the extracellular ($V_{ext}$, top) and membrane potential of a layer 2/3 pyramidal cell ($V_m$, bottom). In the middle, we show the time-varying high-gamma power (brown thin line) and its smoothed fluctuations (brown thick line, the pLFP signal). The $p_0$ value (brown dotted line) corresponds to the first 100th percentile of the pLFP distribution over the whole recording.

This is achieved by varying independently a root frequency $f$ and a width factor $w$ yielding the frequency band [$f$/$w$, $f \cdot w$]. For each frequency band, we divide the band into 20 evenly spaced wavelet frequencies, we compute the mean over frequencies of the wavelet power (resulting in the time-varying power shown in \textbf{a}) and report the cross-correlation with the $V_m$ trace (cc $V_m$-pLFP). The optimal band is found for $f_{opt}$={f0}Hz and $w_{opt}$={w0}. (c) Testing the effect of temporal smoothing on the cross-correlation with the $V_m$ signal.

*** The time-varying high-gamma power of the extracellular potential exhibits a high correlation with the membrane potential of pyramidal neurons in awake mice S1. 

So far, the different waking states in rodent sensory cortices have been evidenced from their membrane potential signature (McGinley et al. 2015b) while the analysis of the extracellular potential have been restricted to evidence the presence of slow oscillatory activity (Crochet and Petersen 2006; Poulet and Petersen 2008; Pala and Petersen 2018). To take advantage of this existing classification, we looked for a transformation of the extracellular signal $V_{ext}$ that would display temporal fluctuations qualitatively similar to those of the membrane potential $V_m$. 

A first candidate quantity that ressembles the $V_m$ fluctuations is the extracellular potential itself. The negatively-weighted extracellular potential fluctuations can indeed display high correlation values with the membrane potential in awake animals (cc$\sim$0.6, Poulet and Petersen 2008). The extracellular signal is however also subjected to drifts at short (<10s) time scales (e.g. see the drift at the $\sim$5s time scale between episodes (i) and (ii) in Figure {pLFP}a) as well as slow (>1min) drifts over long recordings. Its absolute value therefore does not seem to provide a reliable quantity on which one can rely to perform a robust classification. 

Guided by findings under anesthesia (Mukovski et al. 2006), we hypothesized that the high-frequency content ($f$>40Hz) of the extracellular recording would provide a good predictor of the depolarization level. We therefore apply a wavelet transform to the extracellular signal and looked for the frequency band maximizing the cross-correlation with the membrane potential of a simultaneously recorded cell (see Figure {pLFP}b). We found that the optimal band was achieved for $f_{opt}$={f0}Hz and $w_{opt}$={w0}, i.e. the [{F_band_min},{F_band_max}]Hz band. A temporal smoothing was found to improve the similarity with the $V_m$ signal, the optimal value was found to be $T_{opt}$={Tsmooth}ms. We refer in the following to such smoothed high-gamma power as the "pLFP" (processed Local Field Potential, in analogy with the terminology of Mukovski et al. (2006)) and we interpret this quantity as the time-varying recruitment of local spiking activity in the near cortical network surrounding the extracellular electrode (Buzsáki et al. 2012, Einevoll et al. 2013).

After this transformation of the extracellular signal, we found a qualitative match between the previously evidenced $V_m$ signatures of network states and the signatures in terms of pLFP signal. We highlight this feature on a single cell recording in Figure {NSI}a. We observed rhythmic activity at different power (episodes 1,2) as well as non-rhythmic fluctuations at various mean levels of pLFP signal (episodes 3-6), i.e. patterns of activity sampling the continuum of network states found in rodent sensory cortices during wakefulness (McGinley et al. 2015b). This apparent similarity was more thoroughly investigated in the next sections.

(a) Example samples of activity at different NSI levels (bottom) with their corresponding $V_m$ (top) and pLFP (middle) fluctuations. In episodes (1,2) the pLFP and $V_m$ signals exhibit low frequency activity at different powers. In episodes (3-6) the pLFP and $V_m$ signals exhibit non-rhythmic activity at various levels (in terms of both pLFP and depolarization levels). Two time-varying quantities derived from the pLFP signal are used to classify network states: a weighted estimate of the low frequency content of the pLFP signal $X(t)$ (purple dashed line) and the pLFP sliding mean $Y(t)$ (brown dashed line). A consistency criterion validates a fraction of those as "validated" network states (brown dots).

*** Designing a Network State Index (NSI)

To analyze the occurence of specific network states of wakefulness, we develloped an algorithm classifying patterns of neural activity and mapping them on an arbitrary axis: the Network State Index (NSI). We describe in the following the signal processing step to achieve such a classification. We illustrate this procedure on the time-varying fluctuations of the pLFP signal. 

We first compute the time-varying mean $Y(t)$ of the fluctuations over a long time scale ($T_{mean}$={T_sliding_mean}ms). We also compute the low frequency power of the fluctuations $Pow^{max}_{[2,10]Hz}$ (we take the maximum to account for the fact that rhythmicity can have varying frequencies in the [2,10]Hz band) using a wavelet transform (see Methods). From this last time-varying signal, we define a weighted estimate of the contribution of the slow rhythm to the full signal $X(t) = p_0 + \alpha Pow^{max}_{[2,10]Hz}$ (shown on Figure {pLFP}a together with $Y$). By comparing this estimate with the sliding mean, we classify as "rhythmic" or "non-rhythmic" by computing the sign of the difference: when Y(t)-X(t) is negative, activity is classified as rhythmic, when Y(t)-X(t) is positive, activity is classified as non-rhythmic. To keep the graded aspects of the different network states in our index, we now weight this binary quantity by the amplitude of the pLFP signal in the two regimes. For the rhythmic states the amplitude of the fluctuations is given by $2 \cdot Pow^{max}_{[2,10]Hz}$. For the non-rhythmic states, the amplitude of activity is given by its deviation from the baseline level, i.e. $(Y-p_0)$. Mathematically, this corresponds to a Network State Index (NSI) signal given by Equation {NSI} (see Methods).

The variations of the NSI quantity over representative episodes are shown in Figure {NSI}a. We highlight that the decision process for rhythmic and non-rhythmic states relies on the difference between the $X$ and $Y$ signals with a colored area on the pLFP axis (alternating between purple and kaki colors for rhythmic and non-rhythmic epochs respectively). Then, given this difference, the index is a weighted projection on the negative or positive axis for rhythmic or non-rhythmic epochs respectively (bottom plot).

As the time-varying signal $\textrm{NSI}(t)$ might exhibit arbitrary fluctuations due to the non-zero noise level in both the $Y(t)$ and $X(t)$ quantities (see Figure {NSI}a), we complement this procedure with a consistency criteria to obtain a robust classification. We first define a network states window of $T_{state}$={Tstate}ms with a network state update every $T_{state}/2$={Tstate_update}ms. The consistency criteria requires that within a given time window of extent $T_{state}$, the fluctuations of the NSI signal remains within a fluctuation threshold of the pLFP signal $p_{fluct}^{thre}$ (here taken as our estimate of the pLFP noise level, the $p_0$ value, see Methods). If this condition is not matched, a network state at a well-defined level can not be assessed in this time window. Consequently, the network state is labeled as "unclassified". The motivation behind this arbitrary time scale $T_{state}$ is that it offers a good compromise between two constraints: 1) being long enough to get well defined states (e.g. more than half a cycle for oscillations in the [2,10]Hz range) and 2) being short enough to catch the fast and frequent switches of network states during wakefulness (McGinley et al. 2015b). The "validated states" are highlighted with brown dots over some sample episodes in Figure {NSI}a (bottom) and over a full recording in Figure {NSI}b (bottom). Note in episodes 3-5 (Figure {NSI}a, bottom) how this consistency criterion impedes state validations around sign switches of the time-varying NSI signal (thin black line) or in the presence of strong variations in the NSI signal (at the start of episode 3).

Note that this classification relies on the difference between the average pLFP signal $Y(t)$ and the low-frequency contribution to the signal $X(t)$ (and not on the low frequency power only) because when the pLFP signal increase its [2,10]Hz power also increases (correlation coefficients between $Y$ and $X$ in the NSI>0 episodes {CCs_pLFP_lfPow_in_NR}, p={pvalue_CCs_pLFP_lfPow_in_NR}, one-sample t-test). This phenomenon is visible on Figure {NSI}b, the power in episode 6 is equivalent the power in episode 2 without exhibiting the clear rhythmicity in the pLFP or in the $V_m$ signal that characterizes episode 2 (middle and top plots respectively).

*** Calibration of the rhythmicity condition

The parameter $\alpha$ weights the propensity to classify the network activity as rhythmic. This is visible on Figure {NSI}c, when raising the $\alpha$ parameter, the proportion of rhythmic states gradually increase from $\sim$0\% at $\alpha<1$ to $\sim$100\% at $\alpha$>6. This parameter can therefore be adjusted with respect to the specific context in which the NSI is used (see Discussion). 

We nonetheless asked whether our dataset could give us an indication of the optimal value for this parameter. We used our simultaneous $V_m$ recording to find such a value. In Figure {NSI}d, we show the mean [2,10]Hz power of the membrane potential $V_m$ as a function of the $\alpha$ parameter (after averaging over all episodes classified as rhythmic for a given cell, computed for all n={Ncells} cells). The low frequency $V_m$ power exhibits a clear exponential decay. A natural parameter that insures a consistency between the slow-rhythmicity in the $V_m$ and in the pLFP is therefore provided by the decay constant of this decrease. We fitted this parameter and found it to be $\alpha^{opt}$={alpha_opt}. For such a value, we found a strong decrease in $V_m$ power from rhythmic to non-rhythmic states after (pLFP-based) NSI classification for all cells (paired t-test, p={pvalue_decrease_in_slow_power_Vm_synch_to_asynch}, n={Ncells} cells, see Figure {NSI}e). Similarly, for such a value, the $V_m$ fluctuations of rhythmic episodes exhibited a clear oscillatory pattern after averaging with respect to the phase of the pLFP signal (see Figure {NSI}f) while the pLFP phase has a much weaker impact in the non-rhythmic episodes. The rhythmic episodes displayed a mean hyperpolarization of {mean_depol_from_0_to_pi_synch}mV from the 0-phase to the $\pi$-phase of the pLFP signal while the non-rhythmic episodes displayed an hyperpolarization of {mean_depol_from_0_to_pi_asynch}mV (see Figure {NSI}f). Given the high variability of the depolarization at the single cycle level in both cases, {std_depol_from_0_to_pi_synch}mV for rhythmic episodes and {std_depol_from_0_to_pi_asynch}mV for non-rhythmic episodes (variability of the hyperpolarization level over all cycles), only the rhythmic activity exhibits a high reliability of single cycle depolarization (as quantified by the mean-to-variability ratios across cycles: {mean_to_var_depol_from_0_to_pi_synch} for rhythmic states compared to {mean_to_var_depol_from_0_to_pi_asynch} for non-rhythmic states, p={pval_mean_to_var_depol_from_0_to_pi}, n={Ncells} cells, paired t-test).

It could also be hypothesized that the most accurate classification is the most conservative one, i.e. the one that maximizes the proportion of "unclassified" states. Interestingly, one can see on Figure {NSI}c that such value is achieved for $\alpha$={alpha_opt_of_max_unclassified} (thin grey dashed line), i.e. close to the $\alpha^{opt}$={alpha_opt} estimate (thin purple dashed line, where the proportion of unclassified states reaches {fraction_unclassified_for_alpha_opt}\% of its maximal value) obtained with the above procedure.

(a) Relationship, at the single cell level (shown for Cell 1), between the NSI levels and the properties of the $V_m$ fluctuations. For rhythmic states (NSI<0, purple color), we show the link between the NSI level and the $V_m$ amplitude of the [2,10]Hz power. For non-rhythmic states (NSI<0, kaki color), we show the link between the NSI level and the mean $V_m$ depolarization level over a $T_{state}$={Tstate}ms window. We bin the NSI levels and compute the mean (plain curve) and standard deviation (shaded area) for all episodes falling within this bin. We highlight with grey dots the values of the single episodes visible on Figure {NSI}a (reproduced on the top inset, $V_m$ in black and pLFP in brown). We estimate the dependency of the $V_m$ fluctuations with a linear regression with respect to the NSI level (red dashed curve). (b) Same than *a* for Cell 3.

*** An estimate of the NSI accuracy

We have determined all parameters required for the NSI analysis (summarized in Table {params}) and we now look for an estimate of the accuracy of such characterization. The initial motivation behind this classification was based on a qualitative correspondence between the pLFP and $V_m$ fluctuations. To obtain a cross-validation of our method, we now quantify this similarity across all our recordings.

To perform such a comparison, we now apply the NSI method on the $V_m$ signal. The exact same procedure can indeed be applied by replacing the pLFP signal by the membrane potential $V_m$. The lower bound of the signal $p_0$ is translated into the $V_{m0}$ value by also taking the first 100th percentile of the $V_m$ distribution (see Figure {pLFP}a and Figure {All}a). We compute the sliding mean and the time-varying low frequency power with the same parameters as for the pLFP signal. From this we can derived the $X(t)$ and $Y(t)$ quantities and therefore the "$V_m$-defined NSI" signal according to Equation {NSI}. We now compare the value of the "$V_m$-defined NSI" signal during the validated network states of the "pLFP-defined NSI" signal. 

We implement a strict criteria to compare the two values. This procedure is depicted in Figure {All}c. We first determine the scaling rule $F$ between the "$V_m$-defined NSI" signal ($\textrm{NSI}_{V_m}$) and the "pLFP-defined NSI" signal ($\textrm{NSI}_{\textrm{pLFP}}$) by performing a linear fit of the data predicting either both rythmicity or both non-rhythmicity (i.e. on the lower left or the upper right of the plots in Figure {All}c). Then a given time-point $t_i$ is associated to a correct network state identification if the difference between the predicted and observed point lies within a tolerance interval defined by the values $p^{tol}$ and $V_m^{tol}$. For $p^{tol}$, we took the average noise level of the pLFP signal across recordings, i.e. $p_{noise}$={p_noise_for_accuracy}. For $V_m^{tol}$, we arbitrarily took $V_m^{tol}$=2mV. The matching condition is therefore fullfilled if $ F\big( \textrm{NSI}_{V_m}(t_i) + V_m^{tol} \big) < \textrm{NSI}_{\textrm{pLFP}}(t_i) + p_{noise}$ and $ F\big( \textrm{NSI}_{V_m}(t_i) - V_m^{tol} \big) > \textrm{NSI}_{\textrm{pLFP}}(t_i) - p_{noise}$. The strictness of this criteria can be seen in Figure {All}c. Not only the states are taken as incorrect when there is a mismatch between the rhythmic vs non-rhythmic conditions (what happens in cells 2,4,6,7,8, see the non-matching events highlighed with a red cross) but also when the graded level of the rhythmicity or the non-rhythmicity is not matched (what happens in cells 1,3,5). For example, in cell 1, the $\textrm{NSI}_{V_m}$ value does not display a high enough value to be linearly related to $\textrm{NSI}_{pLFP}$ level according to the relationship $F$).

Given the previous tolerance criteria, the final accuracy was found to be {matching_percentage_NSI_pLFP_Vm}\% over the n={Ncells} cells and all validated episodes. 

Lowering the tolerance to $p^{tol}$={p_noise_for_accuracy_strict}$\mu$V and $V_m^{tol}$={Vm_noise_for_accuracy_strict}mV led to an accuracy of {matching_percentage_NSI_pLFP_Vm_strict}\%, meaning that in more than half of the cases the network state could be identified with a remarkable precision. It should also be noted that this accuracy value holds under the hypothesis that the $V_m$ classification would perfectly predict network states. Because a single pyramidal neuron samples only a finite amount of synapses, the relationship between its depolarization level and the endogenous local activity should be noisy. This estimate should therefore be interpreted as a lower bound of the method's accuracy. 

The misclassification was however not homogeneous among the different rejection cases. One specific case, namely predicting non-rhythmic activity from the pLFP ($\textrm{NSI}_{pLFP}$>0) while predicting rhythmic activity from the $V_m$ signal ($\textrm{NSI}_{V_m}$<0), represented {misclassification_pLFP_NR_Vm_R}\% of the misclassifications over the merged episodes across all cells (i.e. {misclassification_pLFP_NR_Vm_R_total}\% of all episodes). We analyze in the next section the origin of this phenomenon.

*** Graded aspect of network states in terms of pLFP and $V_m$ fluctuations: rhythmic versus non-rhythmic states

From the previous analysis, we find a stronger tendency to classify network states as rhythmic from the $V_m$ than from the pLFP fluctuations. Such a specific bias suggests that the fluctuations in terms of pLFP and $V_m$ signal are not exactly symmetric with respect to the NSI measure. We therefore analyzed more closely the correlate in terms of $V_m$ fluctuations of the different levels of NSI. 

For non-rhythmic activity (NSI>0), the level of the network state index is given by the mean pLFP in the time window $T_{state}$={Tstate}ms, we compare this quantity to the mean membrane potential depolarization level in the same window $T_{state}$ (the depolarization is estimated as the deflection from a minimum polarization level, estimated as the mean $V_m$ level when pLFP<$p_0$). For rhythmic activity (NSI<0), the level of the network state index is given by the value of the maximum power of the pLFP signal in the [2,10]Hz band, we compare this quantity to the same power in the $V_m$ signal. We show the relationship between those pLFP-defined and $V_m$-defined levels for two cells in Figure {Granul}a,b (for Cell 1 and Cell 3 respectively) and on Figure {Granul}c we show the population data for those relationships.

We found that the depolarization level exhibits a strong dependency on the NSI level for rhythmic activity (NSI>0), see Figure {Granul}. We show single episodes of increasing NSI levels (numbered 3,4,5,6 in Figure {Granul}a,b) and their respective episode averages at all NSI>0 levels for those two cells (kaki curves in Figure {Granul}a,b). The $\sim$15$\mu$V variability in terms of NSI levels is translated into a $\sim$30mV variability of depolarization level with a clear monotonic relationship for those two sample cells. This behavior was confirmed at the population level (Figure {Granul}c). We standardized the analysis across all cells by binning the NSI levels from 0$\mu$V to {NSI_Max_for_granularity_analysis}$\mu$V (a range covering all observed values) in bins of {NSI_bin_for_granularity_analysis}$\mu$V and, for each cell, we consider only the NSI levels including more than {NEpisode_MIN_for_granularity_analysis} episodes to get a meaningful average. We found that all cells exhibited depolarizations with a steep dependency on the NSI level {value_of_slopes_for_nonrhythmic_granularity_analysis}mV$/ \mu$V, significantly deviating from the null hypothesis of a zero slope (p={pvalue_slopes_for_nonrhythmic_granularity_analysis}, n={n_slopes_for_nonrhythmic_granularity_analysis} cells, paired t-test).

On the other hand, we found that the level of NSI for rhythmic activity (NSI<0) had a much lower impact on the depolarization level, see Figure {Granul}. The $\sim$10$\mu$V variability in terms of NSI levels is now translated into a weakly modulated $V_m$ oscillation with a 5-10mV amplitude (purple curves in Figure {Granul}a,b). We highlight this weak dependency on the selected samples shown in Figure {Granul}a,b. From episode (2) to episode (1), the amplitude of the envelope of the pLFP oscillation increases (decreasing NSI) while the $V_m$ amplitude can either increase (Figure {Granul}a) or decrease (Figure {Granul}b). Now binning the NSI levels from -{NSI_Max_for_granularity_analysis}$\mu$V to 0$\mu$V, we performed this analysis on all cells. At the population level, we also found that the mean depolarization had a weak dependency on the NSI level {value_of_slopes_for_rhythmic_granularity_analysis}mV$/ \mu$V which was not significantly deviating from the null hypothesis of a zero slope (p={pvalue_slopes_for_rhythmic_granularity_analysis}, over the n={n_slopes_for_rhythmic_granularity_analysis} cells displaying rhythmic activity within multiple NSI bins, paired t-test). It should be noted that the lack of graded $V_m$ response for rhythmic activity was not related to the thresholding that reduced the NSI range of (NSI<0) intervals. When raising $\alpha$ up to 5 (where the range of NSI<0 values is greatly increased, because low pLFP episodes are now classified as rhythmic, see Figure {Granul}e), the depolarization level still shows a very weak dependency to the NSI level compared to the dependency observed for non-rhythmic activity (Figure {Granul}c, top) with similar statistical significance values (see Figure {Granul}c, bottom). 

We conclude that the graded levels captured by the NSI has a strong correlate in terms of membrane potential polarization for non-rhythmic activity (NSI>0) while the various NSI levels of rhythmic activity (NSI<0) rather correspond to a stereotypical $V_m$ oscillation with $\sim$5-10mV amplitude.

This finding therefore explains the observed bias in our cross-validation analysis. The stereotypical (weakly gradual) [2,10]Hz $V_m$ patterns are easily classified as rhythmic even when the pLFP patterns have a weak [2,10]Hz amplitude (the misclassification cases indeed originate from episodes of low [2,10]Hz power in the pLFP signal, the mean power in misclassified cases is significantly lower than in cross-validated cases, {pLFP_low_freq_pow_for_wrong_nonrhythmic}$\mu$V versus {pLFP_low_freq_pow_for_true_rhythmic}$\mu$V, p={pvalue_low_freq_pow_for_wrong_nonrhythmic} paired t-test, in the n={n_low_freq_pow_for_wrong_nonrhythmic} cells displaying both conditions). The opposite situation, predicting non-rhythmic activity from the $V_m$ signal ($\textrm{NSI}_{Vm}$>0) represented a much weaker fraction {misclassification_pLFP_R_Vm_NR}\% of the misclassifications (i.e. {misclassification_pLFP_R_Vm_NR_total}\% of all episodes) and can likely be attributed to \textit{private} fluctuations in the $V_m$ signal. Finally, the strong relationship between the pLFP and $V_m$ signals during non-rhythmic states (Figure {Granul}a-c, kaki curves) insured a reliable prediction of the network states by representing only {misclassification_pLFP_NR_Vm_NR}\% of the misclassifications (i.e. {misclassification_pLFP_NR_Vm_NR_total}\%  of all episodes).

*** Network state distributions captured by the NSI in the somato-sensory cortex of awake head-fixed mice

We now analyze the output of this classification on the whole dataset of the present study, the n={Ncells} simultaneous $V_m$ and $V_{ext}$ recordings in the somato-sensory cortex of head-fixed awake mice. We show on Figure {All} height example recordings representative of the dataset, i.e. spanning the full range of correlations between the pLFP and $V_m$ fluctuations (see Figure {pLFP}c). We show a 30s sample of the intra- and extracellular recordings together with the time-varying NSI on Figure {All}a and the histogram of the NSI levels across the whole recording in Figure {All}b.

Overall, the dataset was dominated by non-rhythmic activity with $F_{NSI>0}$={occurence_of_nonrhythmic}\%. The fraction of rhythmic activity exhibited a large variability with n={n_fraction_below_2} recordings below $F_{NSI<0}$=2\% and n={n_fraction_above_35} recordings above $F_{NSI<0}$=35\% (peaking at $F_{NSI<0}$={max_occurence_of_rhythmic}\% for Cell 3, see Figure {All}b).

The mean absolute NSI values were $\langle \| \textrm{NSI}_{NSI<0} \| \rangle $={mean_NSI_of_rhythmic}$\mu$V over rhythmic periods and $\langle \| \textrm{NSI}_{NSI>0} \| \rangle $={mean_NSI_of_nonrhythmic}$\mu$V for non-rhythmic periods, yielding a significant increase from rhythmic to non-rhythmic (p={pvalue_mean_NSI}, paired t-test). The increased amplitude in terms of pLFP signal (i.e. high frequency content of the LFP) suggests that, as an average, the synaptic activity is stronger in the non-rhythmic periods that in the rhythmic ones. This increased range of pLFP level was also true for the maximum level displayed by single recordings with {max_NSI_of_rhythmic}$\mu$V versus {max_NSI_of_nonrhythmic}$\mu$V (p={pvalue_max_NSI}, paired t-test) for rhythmic and non-rhythmic activity respectively. During non-rhythmic periods we also found a weakly significant increase of the variability (standard deviation, from {std_NSI_of_rhythmic}$\mu$V to {std_NSI_of_nonrhythmic}$\mu$V, p={pvalue_std_NSI}, paired t-test) and skewness of the pLFP values (from {skew_NSI_of_rhythmic} to {skew_NSI_of_nonrhythmic}, p={pvalue_skew_NSI}, paired t-test).

(a) We perform a linear-regression between cc($V_m$-pLFP) and the following statistical quantities characterizing the NSI distribution: 1) the variability $\sigma_{NSI}$ (standard deviation) of the NSI values across the whole recording, 2) the variability in NSI values restricted to non-rhythmic episodes $\sigma_{NSI>0}$, 3) the fraction of rhythmic episodes $F_{NSI<0}$, 4) the mean NSI over the whole recording, 5) the variability in NSI values restricted to rhythmic episodes $\sigma_{NSI<0}$, 6) the mean in NSI values restricted to non-rhythmic episodes $\sigma_{NSI>0}$, 7) the mean in NSI values restricted to rhythmic episodes $\sigma_{NSI<0}$. We show the explained variance for all quantities on the x-axis and p-value of this linear dependency. We also performed multiple linear regressions with all those factors (dark gray bar) and the best three-component model (light gray bar, ($\sigma_{NSI>0}$, $F_{NSI<0}$, $\sigma_{NSI<0}$)). We report the variance corrected by the number of linear factors (adjusted $R^2$). (b) Scatter plot between the value of a given factor and the cc($V_m$, pLFP) across individual recordings.

*** Network state variability within a single recording shape the average correlation between population and single cell signals

Finally, we use the above NSI distribution properties to analyze one of the striking property of this dataset: the strong variability from recording to recording (see Figure {pLFP}c and Figure {All}a) of the correlation cc($V_m$, pLFP) between the time-varying population signal pLFP$(t)$ and the single cell signal $V_m(t)$. 

From top to bottom in Figure {All}b (i.e. from high to low correlation recordings), one can see that the distribution of NSI levels across the recordings gets qualitatively and quantitatively different. At the top (high correlations, Cells 1-3), distributions are clearly bimodal with two high peaks both in the rhythmic (NSI<0) and non-rhythmic (NSI<0) areas. At the bottom (low correlations, Cells 11,14), distributions are now clearly dominated by non-rhythmic epochs with a rather narrow extent of NSI values within the (NSI>0) domain. To quantify such features within the single recording distributions, we decomposed each distribution into the following quantities: the mean NSI over the whole recording $\mu_{\textrm{NSI}}$, the variability (standard deviation) of the full NSI distribution $\sigma_{\textrm{NSI}}$, the fraction of rhythmic episodes $F_{\textrm{NSI}<0}$, the mean in NSI values restricted to non-rhythmic episodes $\mu_{\textrm{NSI}>0}$, the mean in NSI values restricted to rhythmic episodes $\mu_{\textrm{NSI}<0}$, the variability in NSI values restricted to non-rhythmic episodes $\sigma_{\textrm{NSI}>0}$ and the variability in NSI values restricted to rhythmic episodes $\sigma_{\textrm{NSI}<0}$. We show the results of a linear regression analysis for each factor in Figure {Correl}a (ordered by explained variance). 

The factor explaining the highest percentage of the variability with {rsquared_$\sigma_{NSI}$}\% of the full variability was the standard deviation of the NSI distribution $\sigma_{\textrm{NSI}}$. Strikingly, the fraction of (synchronous) rhythmic states was only the third most important factor with an explained variance of {rsquared_$F_{NSI<0}$}\%. A more important factor was found to be the variability of network states within non-rhythmic states $\sigma_{\textrm{NSI}>0}$ with an explained variance of {rsquared_$\sigma_{NSI>0}$}\%. Cell 2 in Figure {All} provides an example of such a phenomena, it exhibits a strong variability in terms of non-rhythmic states and a relatively low occurence of rhythmic activity (e.g. lower than Cell 6), and still, displays a high correlation coefficient (cc($V_m$, pLFP)=0.66). Other individual factors did not reach statistical significance (p>0.05, see Figure {Correl}a). However, using a multiple linear regression including all factors, we found that different components of the NSI distributions had synergistic contributions in shaping the average correlation per recording, the full linear model indeed yielded an explained variance of {rsquared_full_regression_model}\% (after correction by the number of linear factors, f-test p={pvalue_full_regression_model}). Trying to reduce the dimensionality of the linear model (up to three components), we found that combining the significant sub-components of the NSI variability ($\sigma_{NSI>0}$ and $F_{NSI<0}$) with the variability within rhythmic states $\sigma_{\textrm{NSI}<0}$ produced a statistically-significant model (f-test, p={pvalue_3_factor_model}) predicting {rsquared_3_factor_model}\% of the variability (corrected by the number of factors).

We conclude that, in the present dataset, the average correlation between a single cell signal ($V_m$) and the population signal (pLFP) can be largely explained (up to $\sim$80\%) by features of the NSI distributions. State variability among all NSI-defined states ($\sigma_{\textrm{NSI}}$) is a critical factor in determining such a variability. We decomposed this state variability and found that the two most prominent factors are the variability within non-rhythmic states ($\sigma_{\textrm{NSI}>0}$) followed by the occurence of synchronous rhythmic activity ($F_{NSI<0}$). 

* Discussion

From this processed LFP, we derive 

In the present study, we derived a characterization of waking states relying on extracellular signals. We introduced a quantitative measure in terms of neurophysiological signal for the "U-model" of arousal (McGinley et al. 2015b): the Network State Index (NSI). We showed that such a measure was applicable to both the intracellular potential of a pyramidal cell as well as to the high-gamma power of the extracellular potential (pLFP). Those results extend the findings of Mukovski et al. (2007). In that study, the authors were able to identity active and silent states (Up and Down respectively) under anesthesia from the pLFP signal (with a slightly different frequency band of the LFP: 20-100 Hz, instead of the data-driven [{F_band_min},{F_band_max}]Hz band here). Here, we show that such procedures also captures the various states of wakefulness: a graded level of regimes ranging from slow (2-10 Hz) oscillatory activity to desynchronized states at various levels of spiking activity. We used this characterization to analyze how the distribution of network states within a recording period shaped the average correlations between the single cell (intracellular) and population (extracellular) signals. We found that the variability of network states, beyond the occurrence of slow synchronous activity, is the main factor shaping the average correlations between single cell and population signals in neocortex.

Importantly, although we provide optimal parameters based on the cross-validation with the $V_m$ fluctuations (see Table {params}), the present classification is flexible and can be adjusted to the specific context in which the NSI is used. For example, the $\alpha$ parameter is the critical parameter separating rhythmic and non-rhythmic fluctuations. If an investigation focuses on slow rhythmic activity, one should be rather conservative in its determination and a low $\alpha$ parameter could be preferred (e.g. $\alpha$=2). On the other hand if an investigation focuses on asynchronous dynamics (non-rhythmic states), a higher $\alpha$ would be a conservative value (e.g. $\alpha$>3).

Interpreting the pLFP signal (the high-gamma power of the extracellular recording) as the amount of spiking activity within the local network surrounding the electrode (Buzsáki et al. 2012; Einevoll et al. 2013; Ray et al. 2008; Ray and Maunsell 2011), the present results provide important insights on the neurophysiogical basis of the different regimes of wakefulness. First, this analysis provides a hierarchy in the synaptic recruitment of the different regimes. For example, some non-rhythmic epochs correspond to very high pLFP levels (e.g. episode 6 in Figure {NSI}a) and such levels are never achieved under rhythmic conditions. Overall, the rhythmic epochs have synaptic activity levels lying in-between the very low and very high levels of the non-rhythmic periods. Second, the steep and robust relationship between the pLFP level and single cell depolarization suggests a critical involvment of the local spiking activity during non-rhythmic regimes. On the other hand, the weaker relationship found during rhythmic epochs suggest that the rhythmic pattern has a weaker dependency on the local spiking activity.

This last phenomenon was also found to be at the origin of the main limitation of the present characterization. Because of the occasionally low level of the pLFP signal during rhythmic activity, the NSI exhibits a bias toward low activity non-rhythmic states when evaluated from extracellular recordings (characterized from the $V_m$ recording). However, despite those limitations, the overall high matching value obtained through cross-validation ($\sim$80\% correct) suggests that the NSI is a valid index to characterize the various network states of wakefulness. Given the widespread use of extracellular recordings in neuroscientific research (Panzeri et al. 2015), the present characterization might turn out an important methodological advance to unveil the mechanisms and functions of state-dependent computations in neocortex.

# This rather suggests that, to some degree, this pattern would be externally generated or would involve a low number of synaptic connections in the local network. 
# Rhytmicity might emerge from intrinsic pacemaker-like conductances in a few cells targeting the local network

# Importantly, this increased statistical dependency demonstrates that not only the occurence of the rhythmic activity explains the correlation between the $V_m$ and the pLFP, but more generally the variability in network states (i.e. also the variability in non-rhythmic states).

\caption{ \textbf{Parameters of the NSI characterization.}
We summarize here all analysis parameters. We separate the parameters into two classes: the fixed parameters that are constant across different recordings (although there value has been experimentally determined from the average data, see Figure {pLFP} and Figure {NSI}) and the data-driven parameters that are evaluated on single recordings.}

*** FIGURE: Wavelet transform with its custom normalization
#+options : {'label':'Morlet', 'extent':'singlecolumn'}
(a) The Morlet wavelet at different frequencies (real and imaginary parts as plain and dashed lines respectively). (b) Time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet transform. Note that the chosen normalization (normalizing with respect to a sinusoid rather than the wavelet itself) insures that the amplitude of a modulated signals is kept in the amplitude of the wavelet transform.

*** FIGURE: Dependency on the $\alpha$ parameter for the link between the granularity of the pLFP-defined networks states and the granularity of the $V_m$ fluctuations
#+options : {'label':'SuppGranul', 'width':0.99}
From left to right, we increase the $\alpha$ parameter: (a) $\alpha$=1 (b) $\alpha$=2.3 (c) $\alpha$=3.7 (d) $\alpha$=5. Note that despite an increase in the NSI range of observed low-frequency activity (when we raise $\alpha$, more low pLFP amplitude events are classified as rhythmic, thus extending the NSI range of variations toward low values) the relationship to the depolarization level is poorly affected. On the other hand, at all $\alpha$, the non-rhythmic events have a depolarization level exhibiting a steep dependency to the NSI level.
