Indeed, V1 lesions substantially reduce visual responses throughout the cortex. Visual information enters the cortex also through the superior colliculus (SC), but the function of this input on visual responses in the cortex is less clear. SC lesions affect cortical visual responses less than V1 lesions, and no visual cortical area appears to entirely rely on SC inputs. We show that visual responses in a mouse lateral visual cortical area called the postrhinal cortex are independent of V1 and are abolished upon silencing of the SC. This area outperforms V1 in discriminating moving objects. We thus identify a collicular primary visual cortex that is independent of the geniculo-cortical pathway and is capable of motion discrimination.},

It has been hypothesized that a brief time window of activity in each area is sufficient to enable the decision but direct measurements of this time window are lacking. To address this question, we develop a visual discrimination task in mice that depends on visual cortex and in which we precisely control the time window of visual cortical activity as the animal performs the task at different levels of difficulty. We show that threshold duration of activity in visual cortex enabling perceptual discrimination is between 40 and 80 milliseconds. During this time window the vast majority of neurons discriminating the stimulus fire one or no spikes and less than 16% fire more than two. This result establishes that the firing of the first visually evoked spikes in visual cortex is sufficient to enable a perceptual decision.},

Here we report and publicly release a biophysically detailed circuit model of layer 4 in the mouse primary visual cortex, receiving thalamo-cortical visual inputs. The 45,000-neuron model was subjected to a battery of visual stimuli, and results were compared to published work and new in vivo experiments. Simulations reproduced a variety of observations, including effects of optogenetic perturbations. Critical to the agreement between responses in silico and in vivo were the rules of functional synaptic connectivity between neurons. Interestingly, after extreme simplification the model still performed satisfactorily on many measurements, although quantitative agreement with experiments suffered. These results emphasize the importance of functional rules of cortical wiring and enable a next generation of data-driven models of in vivo neural activity and computations.},

The visual cortex is one of the main stages in the mammalian nervous system in which the direction of motion may be computed de novo. Experiments and theories indicate that cortical neurons respond selectively to motion direction by combining inputs that provide information about distinct spatial locations with distinct time delays. Despite the importance of this spatiotemporal offset for direction selectivity, its origin and cellular mechanisms are not fully understood. We show that approximately 80 ± 10 thalamic neurons, which respond with distinct time courses to stimuli in distinct locations, excite mouse visual cortical neurons during visual stimulation. The integration of thalamic inputs with the appropriate spatiotemporal offset provides cortical neurons with a primordial bias for direction selectivity. These data show how cortical neurons selectively combine the spatiotemporal response diversity of thalamic neurons to extract fundamental features of the visual world.},

  abstract        = {Channelrhodopsins are light-gated cation channels that have been widely used for optogenetic stimulation of electrically excitable cells. Replacement of a glutamic acid in the central gate with a positively charged amino acid residue reverses the ion selectivity and produces chloride-conducting ChRs (ChloCs). Expressed in neurons, published ChloCs produced a strong shunting effect but also a small, yet significant depolarization from the resting potential. Depending on the state of the neuron, the net result of illumination might therefore be inhibitory or excitatory with respect to action potential generation. Here we report two additional amino acid substitutions that significantly shift the reversal potential of improved ChloC (iChloC) to the reversal potential of endogenous GABAA receptors. As a result, light-evoked membrane depolarization was strongly reduced and spike initiation after current injection or synaptic stimulation was reliably inhibited in iChloC-transfected neurons in vitro. In the primary visual cortex of anesthetized mice, activation of iChloC suppressed spiking activity evoked by visual stimulation. Due to its high operational light sensitivity, iChloC makes it possible to inhibit neurons in a large volume of brain tissue from a small, point-like light source.},

  abstract        = {The mammalian visual cortex massively innervates the brainstem, a phylogenetically older structure, via cortico-fugal axonal projections. Many cortico-fugal projections target brainstem nuclei that mediate innate motor behaviours, but the function of these projections remains poorly understood. A prime example of such behaviours is the optokinetic reflex (OKR), an innate eye movement mediated by the brainstem accessory optic system, that stabilizes images on the retina as the animal moves through the environment and is thus crucial for vision. The OKR is plastic, allowing the amplitude of this reflex to be adaptively adjusted relative to other oculomotor reflexes and thereby ensuring image stability throughout life. Although the plasticity of the OKR is thought to involve subcortical structures such as the cerebellum and vestibular nuclei, cortical lesions have suggested that the visual cortex might also be involved. Here we show that projections from the mouse visual cortex to the accessory optic system promote the adaptive plasticity of the OKR. OKR potentiation, a compensatory plastic increase in the amplitude of the OKR in response to vestibular impairment, is diminished by silencing visual cortex. Furthermore, targeted ablation of a sparse population of cortico-fugal neurons that specifically project to the accessory optic system severely impairs OKR potentiation. Finally, OKR potentiation results from an enhanced drive exerted by the visual cortex onto the accessory optic system. Thus, cortico-fugal projections to the brainstem enable the visual cortex, an area that has been principally studied for its sensory processing function, to plastically adapt the execution of innate motor behaviours.},

  abstract        = {Behavior is derived from the configuration of synaptic connectivity among functionally diverse neurons. Fine motor behavior is absent at birth in most mammals but gradually emerges during subsequent postnatal corticospinal system maturation; the nature of circuit development and reorganization during this period has been largely unexplored. We investigated connectivity and synaptic signaling among functionally distinct corticospinal populations in Fischer 344 rats from postnatal day 18 through 75 using retrograde tracer injections into specific spinal cord segments associated with distinct aspects of forelimb function. Primary motor cortex slices were prepared enabling simultaneous patch-clamp recordings of up to four labeled corticospinal neurons and testing of 3489 potential synaptic connections. We find that, in immature animals, local connectivity is biased toward corticospinal neurons projecting to the same spinal cord segment; this within-population connectivity significantly decreases through maturation until connection frequency is similar between neurons projecting to the same (within-population) or different (across-population) spinal segments. Concomitantly, postnatal maturation is associated with a significant reduction in synaptic efficacy over time and an increase in intrinsic neuronal excitability, altering how excitation is effectively transmitted across recurrent corticospinal networks. Collectively, the postnatal emergence of fine motor control is associated with a relative broadening of connectivity between functionally diverse cortical motor neurons and changes in synaptic properties that could enable the emergence of smaller independent networks, enabling fine motor movement. These changes in synaptic patterning and physiological function provide a basis for the increased capabilities of the mature versus developing brain.},

In slices of the primary motor cortex (M1), we simultaneously recorded from pairs of corticospinal neurons associated with control of distinct motor outputs: distal forelimb versus proximal forelimb. Activation of ChR2-expressing thalamocortical afferents in M1 before motor learning produced equivalent responses in monosynaptic excitation of neurons controlling the distal and proximal forelimb, suggesting balanced thalamic input at baseline. Following skilled grasp training, however, thalamocortical input shifted to bias activation of corticospinal neurons associated with control of the distal forelimb. This increase was associated with a cell-specific increase in mEPSC amplitude but not presynaptic release probability. These findings demonstrate distinct and highly segregated plasticity of thalamocortical projections during adult learning.},

These corticothalamic neurons mediate widespread inhibition across all cortical layers by recruiting fast-spiking inhibitory neurons whose cell body resides in deep cortical layers yet whose axons arborize throughout all layers. This study reveals a circuit by which L6 modulates cortical activity and identifies an inhibitory neuron able to regulate the strength of cortical responses throughout cortical depth.},

  abstract     = {THE ACTIVITY OF PYRAMIDAL CELLS IS CONTROLLED BY TWO OPPOSING FORCES: synaptic inhibition and synaptic excitation. Interestingly, these synaptic inputs are not distributed evenly across the dendritic trees of cortical pyramidal cells. Excitatory synapses are densely packed along only the more peripheral dendrites, but are absent from the proximal stems and the soma. In contrast, inhibitory synapses are located throughout the dendritic tree, the soma, and the axon initial segment. Thus both excitatory and inhibitory inputs exist on the peripheral dendritic tree, while the proximal segments only receive inhibition. The functional consequences of this uneven organization remain unclear. We used both optogenetics and dynamic patch clamp techniques to simulate excitatory synaptic conductances in pyramidal cells, and then assessed how their firing output is modulated by gamma-amino-butyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor activation at different regions of the somatodendritic axis. We report here that activation of GABAA receptor on the same dendritic compartment as excitatory inputs causes a rightwards shift in the function relating firing rate to excitatory conductance (the input-output function). In contrast, GABAA receptor activation proximal to the soma causes both a rightwards shift and also a reduction in the maximal firing rate. The experimental data are well reproduced in a simple, four compartmental model of a neuron with inhibition either on the same compartment, or proximal, to the excitatory drive.},

We optogenetically silenced the visual cortex of mice to isolate thalamic excitation onto layer 4 neurons during visual stimulation. Thalamic excitation contributed to a third of the total excitation and was organized in spatially offset, yet overlapping, ON and OFF receptive fields. This receptive field structure predicted the orientation tuning of thalamic excitation. Finally, both thalamic and total excitation were similarly tuned to orientation and direction and had the same temporal phase relationship to the visual stimulus. Our results indicate that tuning of thalamic excitation is unlikely to be imparted by direction- or orientation-selective thalamic neurons and that a principal role of cortical circuits is to amplify tuned thalamic excitation.},

However, while the functional properties of cortical neurons (e.g., tuning to sensory stimuli) are necessarily determined in vivo, detailed cellular and synaptic analysis relies on in vitro techniques. Here we describe an approach that combines in vivo calcium imaging (for functional characterization) with photo-activation of fluorescent proteins (for neuron labeling), thereby allowing targeted in vitro recording of multiple neurons with known functional properties. We expressed photo-activatable GFP rendered non-diffusible through fusion with a histone protein (H2B-PAGFP) in the mouse visual cortex to rapidly photo-label constellations of neurons in vivo at cellular and sub-cellular resolution using two-photon excitation. This photo-labeling method was compatible with two-photon calcium imaging of neuronal responses to visual stimuli, allowing us to label constellations of neurons with specific functional properties. Photo-labeled neurons were easily identified in vitro in acute brain slices and could be targeted for whole-cell recording. We also demonstrate that in vitro and in vivo image stacks of the same photo-labeled neurons could be registered to one another, allowing the exact in vivo response properties of individual neurons recorded in vitro to be known. The ability to perform in vitro recordings from neurons with known functional properties opens up exciting new possibilities for dissecting the cellular, synaptic, and circuit mechanisms that underlie neuronal function in vivo.},

  abstract        = {Cerebral cortex is a highly sophisticated computing machine, feeding on information provided by the senses, which is integrated with other, internally generated patterns of neural activity, to trigger behavioural outputs. Bit by bit, we are coming to understand how this may occur, but still, the nature of the 'cortical code' remains one of the greatest challenges in science. As with other great scientific challenges of the past, fresh insights have come from a coalescence of different experimental and theoretical approaches. These theoretical considerations are typically reserved for cortical function rather than cortical pathology. This approach, though, may also shed light on cortical dysfunction. The particular focus of this review is epilepsy; we will argue that the information capacity of different brain states provides a means of understanding, and even assessing, the impact and locality of the epileptic pathology. Epileptic discharges, on account of their all-consuming and stereotyped nature, represent instances where the information capacity of the network is massively compromised. These intense discharges also prevent normal processing in surrounding territories, but in a different way, through enhanced inhibition in these territories. Information processing is further compromised during the period of post-ictal suppression, during interictal bursts, and also at other times, through more subtle changes in synaptic function. We also comment on information processing in other more physiological brain states.},

Interestingly, thalamic contacts with interneurons constitute such a powerful synapse that even one afferent can fire interneurons, thereby driving feedforward inhibition. However, the spatial representation of this potent synapse on interneuron dendrites is poorly understood. Using Ca imaging and electron microscopy we show that an individual thalamic afferent forms multiple contacts with the interneuronal proximal dendritic arbor, preferentially near branch points. More contacts are correlated with larger amplitude synaptic responses. Each contact, consisting of a single bouton, can release up to seven vesicles simultaneously, resulting in graded and reliable Ca transients. Computational modeling indicates that the release of multiple vesicles at each contact minimally reduces the efficiency of the thalamic afferent in exciting the interneuron. This strategy preserves the spatial representation of thalamocortical inputs across the dendritic arbor over a wide range of release conditions.},

Associative synaptic plasticity redistributes the composition of different ensembles recruited by distinct inputs such as to specifically increase the similarity between the ensembles. These results show that in the hippocampus, the ensemble of neurons recruited by a given afferent projection is fluid and can be rapidly and persistently modified to specifically include neurons from different ensembles.

However, whether M/T cells belonging to different olfactory bulb glomeruli converge onto individual cortical cells is unclear. Here we use calcium imaging in an olfactory bulb-cortex slice preparation to provide direct evidence that neurons in piriform cortex receive convergent synaptic input from different glomeruli. We show that the combined activity of distinct glomerular pathways recruits ensembles of pyramidal cells that are not activated by the individual pathways alone. This cooperative recruitment of cortical neurons only occurs over a narrow time window and is a feature intrinsic to the olfactory cortex that can be explained by the integration of converging, subthreshold synaptic input. Cooperative recruitment enhances the differences between cortical representations of partially overlapping input patterns and may contribute to the initial steps of olfactory discrimination.},

Although these features are processed vertically across cortical layers, horizontal projections interconnecting neighbouring cortical domains allow these features to be processed in a context-dependent manner. Despite the wealth of physiological and psychophysical studies addressing the function of horizontal projections, how they coordinate activity among cortical domains remains poorly understood. We addressed this question by selectively activating horizontal projection neurons in mouse somatosensory cortex, and determined how the resulting spatial pattern of excitation and inhibition affects cortical activity. We found that horizontal projections suppress superficial layers while simultaneously activating deeper cortical output layers. This layer-specific modulation does not result from a spatial separation of excitation and inhibition, but from a layer-specific ratio between these two opposing conductances. Through this mechanism, cortical domains exploit horizontal projections to compete for cortical space.},

Consequently, the relative contribution of individual afferents in firing a neuron was inversely proportional to the total number of active afferents. Feedforward inhibition, acting homogeneously across pyramidal cells, ensured that threshold excitatory currents increased with stimulus strength. In contrast, heterogeneities in the distribution of excitatory currents in the neuronal population determined the specific set of pyramidal cells recruited. Together, these mechanisms expand the range of afferent input strengths that neuronal populations can represent.},

This divergence plays a crucial role in coordinating excitation with inhibition during the earliest steps of somatosensory processing in the cortex. Although the same TC afferents contact both FS and RS cells, FS cells receive larger and faster excitatory inputs from individual TC afferents. Here, we show that this larger thalamic excitation of FS cells occurs via GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors (AMPARs), and results from a fourfold larger quantal amplitude compared with the thalamic inputs onto RS cells. Thalamic afferents also activate NMDA receptors (NMDARs) at synapses onto both cells types, yet RS cell NMDAR currents are slower and pass more current at physiological membrane potentials. Because of these synaptic specializations, GluR2-lacking AMPARs selectively maintain feedforward inhibition of RS cells, whereas NMDARs contribute to the spiking of RS cells and hence to cortical recurrent excitation. Thus, thalamic afferent activity diverges into two routes that rely on unique complements of postsynaptic AMPARs and NMDARs to orchestrate the dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition as sensory input enters the cortex.},

Despite notable exceptions in other parts of the nervous system (Schoppa and Urban, 2003; Wässle, 2004; Howard et al., 2005), this route of signal propagation has been shown to underlie the functional properties of most neocortical circuits studied so far. Recent evidence, however, suggests that neocortical excitatory cells may trigger the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA by directly depolarizing the axon terminals of inhibitory interneurons, thus bypassing their somatodendritic compartments (Ren et al., 2007). By using a combination of optical and electrophysiological approaches, we find that synaptically released glutamate fails to trigger GABA release through a direct action on GABAergic terminals under physiological conditions. Rather, our evidence suggests that glutamate triggers GABA release only after somatodendritic depolarization and action potential generation at GABAergic interneurons. These data indicate that neocortical inhibition is recruited by classical somatodendritic integration rather than direct activation of interneuron axon terminals.},

In the hippocampus, despite both targeting the somatic membrane of CA1 pyramidal cells, these two classes of basket cells are active at different times. Differential modulation of these two types of basket cells could hence be important for regulating the activity patterns of CA1 pyramidal cells at very specific periods during ongoing activity. Indeed, cannabinoids selectively suppress the output of one class of basket cell. Whether opioids, another major modulator of inhibition in the hippocampus, also selectively suppress somatic inhibition is not known. Here, we show that basket cells are selectively modulated by either opioids or cannabinoids, but not both. We also find that basket cells are integrated into specific inhibitory subnetworks that are themselves under differential control of opioids and cannabinoids. Furthermore, because the two interneuron types are activated at different times, opioids and cannabinoids suppress different epochs of inhibition. This cell-type specific sensitivity to neuromodulators allows for a fine control of the temporal structure of hippocampal activity.},

Despite receiving the same afferent inputs, the synaptic and biophysical properties of the two cell types were tuned to detect different features of activity. CB1R-negative basket cells responded reliably and immediately to subtle and repetitive excitation. In contrast, CB1R-positive basket cells responded later and did not follow repetitive activity, but were better suited to integrate the consecutive excitation of independent afferents. This temporal separation in the activity of the two basket cell types generated distinct epochs of somatic inhibition that were differentially affected by endocannabinoids.},

This rearrangement is restricted to a critical period that starts a few days or weeks after vision is established and ends before adulthood. In contrast to the original hypothesis proposed by Hubel and Wiesel, ocular dominance columns are already substantially formed before the onset of the critical period. Indeed, before the critical period there is a period of ocular dominance column formation during which there is robust spontaneous activity and visual experience. Recent findings raise important questions about whether activity guides ocular dominance column formation in this 'precritical period'. One developmental event that marks the passage from the precritical period to the critical period is the activation of a GABAergic circuit. How these events trigger the transition from the precritical to critical period is not known.},

Here we show that neighboring excitatory synapses on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells can cooperate in the activation of postsynaptic receptors through the confluence of released glutamate, and that this cooperation is controlled by glutamate uptake. Furthermore, glutamate transporters control temporal interactions between transmitter transients originating from the same axon. Thus, cooperative interactions between excitatory synapses are modulated in space and time by glutamate uptake.},

Rett syndrome features an interesting challenge for biologists and clinicians, as the disorder lies at the intersection of molecular mechanisms of epigenetic regulation and neurophysiological alterations in synapses and circuits that together contribute to severe pathophysiological endophenotypes. Genetic, clinical, and neurobiological evidences support the notion that Rett syndrome is primarily a synaptic disorder, and a disease model for both intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. This review examines major developments in both recent neurobiological and preclinical findings of Rett syndrome, and to what extent they are beginning to impact our understanding and management of the disorder. It also discusses potential applications of knowledge on synaptic plasticity abnormalities in Rett syndrome to its diagnosis and treatment.},

Retrograde tracing shows that inputs to LC-GABA and LC-NA neurons arise from similar regions, though a few regions provide differential inputs to one subtype over the other. Recordings in the locus coeruleus demonstrate two modes of LC-GABA responses whereby spiking is either correlated or broadly anticorrelated with LC-NA responses, reflecting anatomically similar and functionally coincident inputs, or differential and non-coincident inputs, to LC-NA and LC-GABA neurons. Coincident inputs control the gain of LC-NA-mediated arousal responses, whereas non-coincident inputs, such as from the prefrontal cortex to the locus coeruleus, alter global arousal levels. These findings demonstrate distinct modes by which an inhibitory locus coeruleus circuit regulates arousal in the brain.},

Our measurements of physiological responses and tissue-damage thresholds define pulse parameters and safety limits for damage-free three-photon imaging. We image functional visual responses of neurons expressing GCaMP6s across all layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) and in the subplate. These recordings reveal diverse visual selectivity in deep layers: layer 5 neurons are more broadly tuned to visual stimuli, whereas mean orientation selectivity of layer 6 neurons is slightly sharper, compared to neurons in other layers. Subplate neurons, located in the white matter below cortical layer 6 and characterized here for the first time, show low visual responsivity and broad orientation selectivity.},

Guillery (2006) Exploring the Thalamus and Its Role in Cortical Functioning. Academic Press, New York, NY; S.M. Sherman & R.W. Guillery (2013) Functional Connections of Cortical Areas: A New View from the Thalamus. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA and then in his last book (R. Guillery (2017) The Brain as a Tool: A Neuroscientist's Account. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK)], was that the brain is a 'tool' to understand the world. In this view, the brain does not passively process sensory information and use the result to inform motor outputs. Rather, sensory and motor signals are widely broadcast and inextricably linked, with ongoing sensorimotor transformations serving as the basis for interaction with the outside world. Here, we describe recent studies from our laboratory and others which demonstrate this astute framing of the link among sensation, perception, and action postulated by Guillery and others [G. Deco & E.T. Rolls (2005) Prog Neurobiol, 76, 236-256; P. Cisek & J.F. Kalaska (2010) Annu Rev Neurosci, 33, 269-298]. Guillery situated his understanding in the deeply intertwined relationship between the thalamus and cortex, and importantly in the feedback from cortex to thalamus which in turn influences feed-forward drive to cortex [S.M. Sherman & R.W. Guillery (2001) Exploring the Thalamus. Elsevier, Amstrerdam; S. Sherman & R. Guillery (2006) Exploring the Thalamus and Its Role in Cortical Functioning. Academic Press, New York, NY]. We extend these observations to argue that brain mechanisms for sensorimotor transformations involve cortical and subcortical circuits that create internal models as a substrate for action, that a key role of sensory inputs is to update such models, and that a major function of sensorimotor processing underlying cognition is to enable action selection and execution.},

  abstract        = {The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been implicated in perceptual decisions, but whether its role is specific to sensory processing or sensorimotor transformation is not well understood. Here, we trained mice to perform a go/no-go visual discrimination task and imaged the activity of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) and PPC during engaged behavior and passive viewing. Unlike V1 neurons, which respond robustly to stimuli in both conditions, most PPC neurons respond exclusively during task engagement. To test whether signals in PPC primarily encoded the stimulus or the animal's impending choice, we image the same neurons before and after re-training mice with a reversed sensorimotor contingency. Unlike V1 neurons, most PPC neurons reflect the animal's choice of the new target stimulus after re-training. Mouse PPC is therefore strongly task-dependent, reflects choice more than stimulus, and may play a role in the transformation of visual inputs into motor commands.},

This is accompanied by a decrease in the strength of adjacent spines on a slower time scale. The locally coordinated potentiation and depression of spines involves prominent AMPA receptor redistribution via targeted expression of the immediate early gene product Arc. Hebbian strengthening of activated synapses and heterosynaptic weakening of adjacent synapses thus cooperatively orchestrate cell-wide plasticity of functional neuronal responses.},

Though techniques to map calcium-related activity at a high resolution by optical means are well established, there is currently no reliable method to measure calcium dynamics over large volumes in intact tissue   . Here, we address this need by introducing a family of magnetic calcium-responsive nanoparticles (MaCaReNas) that can be detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MaCaReNas respond within seconds to [Ca ] changes in the 0.1-1.0 mM range, suitable for monitoring extracellular calcium signalling processes in the brain. We show that the probes permit the repeated detection of brain activation in response to diverse stimuli in vivo. MaCaReNas thus provide a tool for calcium-activity mapping in deep tissue and offer a precedent for the development of further nanoparticle-based sensors for dynamic molecular imaging with MRI.},

  abstract     = {Microdeletion of a region in chromosome 16p11.2 increases susceptibility to autism. Although this region contains exons of 29 genes, disrupting only a small segment of the region, which spans five genes, is sufficient to cause autistic traits. One candidate gene in this critical segment is  , which encodes for the major vault protein (MVP) that has been implicated in regulation of cellular transport mechanisms. MVP expression levels in   mice closely phenocopy those of 16p11.2 mutant mice, suggesting that   mice may serve as a model of MVP function in 16p11.2 microdeletion. Here we show that MVP regulates the homeostatic component of ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in primary visual cortex.   mice of both sexes show impairment in strengthening of open-eye responses after several days of monocular deprivation (MD), whereas closed-eye responses are weakened as normal, resulting in reduced overall OD plasticity. The frequency of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in pyramidal neurons is decreased in   mice after extended MD, suggesting a reduction of functional synapses. Correspondingly, upregulation of surface GluA1 AMPA receptors is reduced in   mice after extended MD, and is accompanied by altered expression of STAT1 and phosphorylated ERK, which have been previously implicated in OD plasticity. Normalization of STAT1 levels by introducing STAT1 shRNA rescues surface GluA1 and open-eye responses, implicating STAT1 as a downstream effector of MVP. These findings demonstrate a specific role for MVP as a key molecule influencing the homeostatic component of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, and potentially the corresponding phenotypes of 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome.  Major vault protein (MVP), a candidate gene in 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome, has been implicated in the regulation of several cellular processes including transport mechanisms and scaffold signaling. However, its role in brain function and plasticity remains unknown. In this study, we identified MVP as an important regulator of the homeostatic component of experience-dependent plasticity, via regulation of STAT1 and ERK signaling. This study helps reveal a new mechanism for an autism-related gene in brain function, and suggests a broader role for neuro-immune interactions in circuit level plasticity. Importantly, our findings might explain specific components of the pathophysiology of 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome.},

Here we used 2-photon calcium imaging in neuronal birthdate-labeled Mash1-CreER;Ai14 mice to image simultaneously the activity of striosomal and matrix neurons as mice performed an auditory conditioning task. With this method, we identified circumscribed zones of tdTomato-labeled neuropil that correspond to striosomes as verified immunohistochemically. Neurons in both striosomes and matrix responded to reward-predicting cues and were active during or after consummatory licking. However, we found quantitative differences in response strength: striosomal neurons fired more to reward-predicting cues and encoded more information about expected outcome as mice learned the task, whereas matrix neurons were more strongly modulated by recent reward history. These findings open the possibility of harnessing in vivo imaging to determine the contributions of striosomes and matrix to striatal circuit function.},

The synaptic activity of V1 neurons is given as input to the astrocyte layer. The activity of this astrocyte layer is now used to modulate bidirectional plasticity of lateral excitatory connections in the V1 layer. By simply varying the radius of the astrocytes, the extent of lateral excitatory neuronal connections can be manipulated. An increase in the radius of lateral excitatory connections subsequently increases the size of a single hypercolumn in the OPM. When these lateral excitatory connections become small enough the OPM disappears and a salt-and-pepper organization emerges.},

This genetic modification allows sustained cell cycle re-entry, expansion of the progenitor population, and delayed neuronal differentiation, all key features of the developing human cortex. In contrast, Pten deletion in mouse organoids does not lead to folding. Finally, we utilized the expanded cerebral organoids to show that infection with Zika virus impairs cortical growth and folding.

Electron microscopy (EM) allows the ultrastructural imaging of subcellular components but cannot detect fluorescence and lacks temporal resolution. Here, we describe a combination of procedures designed to achieve the correlated imaging of the same individual synapse under both 2PM and EM. This technique permits the selective stimulation and live imaging of a single dendritic spine and the subsequent localization of the same spine in EM ultrathin serial sections. Landmarks created through a photomarking method based on the 2-photon-induced precipitation of an electrodense compound are used to unequivocally localize the stimulated synapse. This technique was developed to image, for the first time, the ultrastructure of the postsynaptic density in which long-term potentiation was selectively induced just seconds or minutes before, but it can be applied for the study of any biological process that requires the precise relocalization of micron-wide structures for their correlated imaging with 2PM and EM.},

The specific activation of ARC glia enhances the activity of agouti-related protein/neuropeptide Y (AgRP/NPY)-expressing neurons but induces no net response in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons. ARC glial activation non-specifically depolarizes both AgRP/NPY and POMC neurons but a strong inhibitory input to POMC neurons balances the excitation. When AgRP/NPY neurons are inactivated, ARC glial activation fails to evoke any significant changes in food intake. Collectively, these results reveal an important role of ARC glia in the regulation of energy homeostasis through its interaction with distinct neuronal subtype-specific pathways.},

Cholinergic neurons from the basal forebrain innervate a wide range of cortical areas, including the primary visual cortex (V1), and multiple cortical cell types have been found to be responsive to ACh. Here we review how different cell types contribute to different cortical functions modulated by ACh. We specifically focus on two major cortical functions: plasticity and cortical state. In layer II/III of V1, ACh acting on astrocytes and somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons plays critical roles in these functions. Cell type specificity of cholinergic modulation points towards the growing understanding that even diffuse neurotransmitter systems can mediate specific functions through specific cell classes and receptors.},

  abstract        = {Rett syndrome (RTT) arises from loss-of-function mutations in methyl-CpG binding protein 2 gene (Mecp2), but fundamental aspects of its physiological mechanisms are unresolved. Here, by whole-cell recording of synaptic responses in MeCP2 mutant mice in vivo, we show that visually driven excitatory and inhibitory conductances are both reduced in cortical pyramidal neurons. The excitation-to-inhibition (E/I) ratio is increased in amplitude and prolonged in time course. These changes predict circuit-wide reductions in response reliability and selectivity of pyramidal neurons to visual stimuli, as confirmed by two-photon imaging. Targeted recordings reveal that parvalbumin-expressing (PV ) interneurons in mutant mice have reduced responses. PV-specific MeCP2 deletion alone recapitulates effects of global MeCP2 deletion on cortical circuits, including reduced pyramidal neuron responses and reduced response reliability and selectivity. Furthermore, MeCP2 mutant mice show reduced expression of the cation-chloride cotransporter KCC2 (K /Cl  exporter) and a reduced KCC2/NKCC1 (Na /K /Cl  importer) ratio. Perforated patch recordings demonstrate that the reversal potential for GABA is more depolarized in mutant mice, but is restored by application of the NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide. Treatment with recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-1 restores responses of PV  and pyramidal neurons and increases KCC2 expression to normalize the KCC2/NKCC1 ratio. Thus, loss of MeCP2 in the brain alters both excitation and inhibition in brain circuits via multiple mechanisms. Loss of MeCP2 from a specific interneuron subtype contributes crucially to the cell-specific and circuit-wide deficits of RTT. The joint restoration of inhibition and excitation in cortical circuits is pivotal for functionally correcting the disorder.},

Large-scale calcium imaging revealed that V1, PPC, and fMC neurons exhibited heterogeneous responses spanning all task epochs (stimulus, delay, response). Population analyses demonstrated unique encoding of stimulus identity and behavioral choice information across regions, with V1 encoding stimulus, fMC encoding choice even early in the trial, and PPC multiplexing the two variables. Optogenetic inhibition during behavior revealed that all regions were necessary during the stimulus epoch, but only fMC was required during the delay and response epochs. Stimulus identity can thus be rapidly transformed into behavioral choice, requiring V1, PPC, and fMC during the transformation period, but only fMC for maintaining the choice in memory prior to execution.},

A variety of recent evidence demonstrates that the phenotypes of Rett Syndrome are present at the earliest stages of brain development, including developmental stages that define neurogenesis, migration, and patterning in addition to stages of synaptic and circuit development and plasticity. These phenotypes arise from the pleotropic effects of MeCP2, which is expressed very early in neuronal progenitors and continues to be expressed into adulthood. The effects of MeCP2 are mediated by diverse signaling, transcriptional, and epigenetic mechanisms. Attempts to reverse the effects of Rett Syndrome need to take into account the developmental dynamics and temporal impact of MeCP2 loss.},

Certain stimuli can suppress this intertrial variability to increase the reliability of neuronal responses. In particular, responses to natural scenes, which have broadband spatiotemporal statistics, are more reliable than responses to stimuli such as gratings. However, very little is known about which stimulus statistics modulate reliable coding and how this occurs at the neural ensemble level. Here, we sought to elucidate the role that spatial correlations in natural scenes play in reliable coding. We developed a novel noise-masking method to systematically alter spatial correlations in natural movies, without altering their edge structure. Using high-speed two-photon calcium imaging in vivo, we found that responses in mouse V1 were much less reliable at both the single neuron and population level when spatial correlations were removed from the image. This change in reliability was due to a reorganization of between-neuron correlations. Strongly correlated neurons formed ensembles that reliably and accurately encoded visual stimuli, whereas reducing spatial correlations reduced the activation of these ensembles, leading to an unreliable code. Together with an ensemble-specific normalization model, these results suggest that the coordinated activation of specific subsets of neurons underlies the reliable coding of natural scenes.},

The next generation of research in neurodevelopmental disorders must address the neural circuitry underlying the behavioral symptoms and comorbidities, the cell types playing critical roles in these circuits, and common intercellular signaling pathways that link diverse genes.

The neural bases of attention and expectation are thought to engage higher cognitive loci; however, their influence at the level of primary visual cortex (V1) remains unknown. Here, we asked whether single-neuron responses in monkey V1 were influenced by an attention task of unpredictable duration. Monkeys covertly attended to a spot that remained unchanged for a fixed period and then abruptly disappeared at variable times, prompting a lever release for reward. We show that monkeys responded progressively faster and performed better as the trial duration increased. Neural responses also followed monkey's task engagement-there was an early, but short duration, response facilitation, followed by a late but sustained increase during the time monkeys expected the attention spot to disappear. This late attentional modulation was significantly and negatively correlated with the reaction time and was well explained by a modified hazard function. Such bimodal, time-dependent changes were, however, absent in a task that did not require explicit attentional engagement. Thus, V1 neurons carry reliable signals of attention and temporal expectation that correlate with predictable influences on monkeys' behavioral responses.},

Selective optogenetic inhibition of SOM responses blocked desynchronization and decorrelation, demonstrating that direct cholinergic activation of SOM neurons is necessary for this phenomenon. Optogenetic inhibition of vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing neurons did not block desynchronization, despite these neurons being activated at high levels of cholinergic drive. Direct optogenetic SOM activation, independent of cholinergic modulation, was sufficient to induce desynchronization. Together, these findings demonstrate a mechanistic basis for temporal structure in cortical populations and the crucial role of neuromodulatory drive in specific inhibitory-excitatory circuits in actively shaping the dynamics of neuronal activity.},

  abstract        = {In primates, visual stimuli with social and emotional content tend to attract attention. Attention might be captured through rapid, automatic, subcortical processing or guided by slower, more voluntary cortical processing. Here we examined whether irrelevant faces with varied emotional expressions interfere with a covert attention task in macaque monkeys. In the task, the monkeys monitored a target grating in the periphery for a subtle color change while ignoring distracters that included faces appearing elsewhere on the screen. The onset time of distracter faces before the target change, as well as their spatial proximity to the target, was varied from trial to trial. The presence of faces, especially faces with emotional expressions interfered with the task, indicating a competition for attentional resources between the task and the face stimuli. However, this interference was significant only when faces were presented for greater than 200 ms. Emotional faces also affected saccade velocity and reduced pupillary reflex. Our results indicate that the attraction of attention by emotional faces in the monkey takes a considerable amount of processing time, possibly involving cortical-subcortical interactions. Intranasal application of the hormone oxytocin ameliorated the interfering effects of faces. Together these results provide evidence for slow modulation of attention by emotional distracters, which likely involves oxytocinergic brain circuits.},

However, the ability to maintain the NSC state independent of the inducing factors and the identity of the somatic donor cells remain two important unresolved issues in transdifferentiation. Here we used transduction of doxycycline-inducible transcription factors to generate stable tripotent NSCs. The induced NSCs (iNSCs) maintained their characteristics in the absence of exogenous factor expression and were transcriptionally, epigenetically, and functionally similar to primary brain-derived NSCs. Importantly, we also generated tripotent iNSCs from multiple adult cell types, including mature liver and B cells. Our results show that self-maintaining proliferative neural cells can be induced from nonectodermal cells by expressing specific combinations of transcription factors.},

The origins of these operations have been variously ascribed to differences in neuron classes, synapse location or receptor conductances. Here, by utilizing specific visual stimuli and single optogenetic probe pulses, we show that the function of parvalbumin-expressing and somatostatin-expressing neurons in mice in vivo is governed by the overlap of response timing between these neurons and their targets. In particular, somatostatin-expressing neurons respond at longer latencies to small visual stimuli compared with their target neurons and provide subtractive inhibition. With large visual stimuli, however, they respond at short latencies coincident with their target cells and switch to provide divisive inhibition. These results indicate that inhibition mediated by these neurons is a dynamic property of cortical circuits rather than an immutable property of neuronal classes.},

From studies at single-cell level to animal behavior, recent advances in technology and genetics have revealed the impact of astrocyte activity in brain function from cellular and synaptic physiology, neuronal circuits to behavior. The present review critically discusses the consequences of astrocyte signaling on synapses and networks, as well as its impact on neuronal information processing, showing that some crucial brain functions arise from the coordinated activity of neuron-glia networks.},

After brief monocular deprivation (MD), STAT1 knock-out (KO) mice show an accelerated increase of open-eye responses, to a level comparable with open-eye responses after a longer duration of MD in wild-type (WT) mice. Therefore, this component of plasticity is abnormally enhanced in KO mice. Conversely, increasing STAT1 signaling by IFNγ treatment in WT mice reduces the homeostatic component of plasticity by impairing open-eye responses. Enhanced plasticity in KO mice is accompanied by sustained surface levels of GluA1 AMPA receptors and increased amplitude and frequency of AMPA receptor-mediated mEPSCs, which resemble changes in WT mice after a longer duration of MD. These results demonstrate a unique role for STAT1 during visual cortical plasticity in vivo through a mechanism that includes AMPA receptors.},

  abstract        = {Rett Syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that arises from mutations in the X-linked gene methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). MeCP2 has a large number of targets and a wide range of functions, suggesting the hypothesis that functional signaling mechanisms upstream of synaptic and circuit maturation may contribute to our understanding of the disorder and provide insight into potential treatment. Here, we show that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) levels are reduced in young male Mecp2-null (Mecp2(-/y)) mice, and systemic treatment with recombinant human IGF1 (rhIGF1) improves lifespan, locomotor activity, heart rate, respiration patterns, and social and anxiety behavior. Furthermore, Mecp2-null mice treated with rhIGF1 show increased synaptic and activated signaling pathway proteins, enhanced cortical excitatory synaptic transmission, and restored dendritic spine densities. IGF1 levels are also reduced in older, fully symptomatic heterozygous (Mecp2(-/+)) female mice, and short-term treatment with rhIGF1 in these animals improves respiratory patterns, reduces anxiety levels, and increases exploratory behavior. In addition, rhIGF1 treatment normalizes abnormally prolonged plasticity in visual cortex circuits of adult Mecp2(-/+) female mice. Our results provide characterization of the phenotypic development of Rett Syndrome in a mouse model at the molecular, circuit, and organismal levels and demonstrate a mechanism-based therapeutic role for rhIGF1 in treating Rett Syndrome.},

Finally, cotreatment with clenbuterol and recombinant human IGF1 results in additional increases in survival in male null mice.

Proteins translocated to the spine in four distinct patterns through three sequential phases. In the initial phase, the actin cytoskeleton was rapidly remodeled while active cofilin was massively transported to the spine. In the stabilization phase, cofilin formed a stable complex with F-actin, was persistently retained at the spine, and consolidated spine expansion. In contrast, the postsynaptic density (PSD) was independently remodeled, as PSD scaffolding proteins did not change their amount and localization until a late protein synthesis-dependent third phase. Our findings show how and when spine substructures are remodeled during LTP and explain why synaptic plasticity rules change over time.},

  abstract        = {Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder mainly affecting females and is associated with mutations in MECP2, the gene encoding methyl CpG-binding protein 2. Mouse models suggest that recombinant human insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (rhIGF1) (mecasermin) may improve many clinical features. We evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profiles of IGF-1 in 12 girls with MECP2 mutations (9 with RTT). In addition, we performed a preliminary assessment of efficacy using automated cardiorespiratory measures, EEG, a set of RTT-oriented clinical assessments, and two standardized behavioral questionnaires. This phase 1 trial included a 4-wk multiple ascending dose (MAD) (40-120 μg/kg twice daily) period and a 20-wk open-label extension (OLE) at the maximum dose. Twelve subjects completed the MAD and 10 the entire study, without evidence of hypoglycemia or serious adverse events. Mecasermin reached the CNS compartment as evidenced by the increase in cerebrospinal fluid IGF-1 levels at the end of the MAD. The drug followed nonlinear kinetics, with greater distribution in the peripheral compartment. Cardiorespiratory measures showed that apnea improved during the OLE. Some neurobehavioral parameters, specifically measures of anxiety and mood also improved during the OLE. These improvements in mood and anxiety scores were supported by reversal of right frontal alpha band asymmetry on EEG, an index of anxiety and depression. Our data indicate that IGF-1 is safe and well tolerated in girls with RTT and, as demonstrated in preclinical studies, ameliorates certain breathing and behavioral abnormalities.},

Here we report that selective photostimulation of astrocytes with channelrhodopsin-2 in primary visual cortex enhances both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, through the activation of type 1a metabotropic glutamate receptors. Photostimulation of astrocytes in vivo increases the spontaneous firing of parvalbumin-positive (PV(+)) inhibitory neurons, while excitatory and somatostatin-positive (SOM(+)) neurons show either an increase or decrease in their activity. Moreover, PV(+) neurons show increased baseline visual responses and reduced orientation selectivity to visual stimuli, whereas excitatory and SOM(+) neurons show either increased or decreased baseline visual responses together with complementary changes in orientation selectivity. Therefore, astrocyte activation, through the dual control of excitatory and inhibitory drive, influences neuronal integrative features critical for sensory information processing.},

Here we show, using an isogenic human embryonic stem cell model of RTT, that MECP2 mutant neurons display key molecular and cellular features of this disorder. Unbiased global gene expression analyses demonstrate that MECP2 functions as a global activator in neurons but not in neural precursors. Decreased transcription in neurons was coupled with a significant reduction in nascent protein synthesis and lack of MECP2 was manifested as a severe defect in the activity of the AKT/mTOR pathway. Lack of MECP2 also leads to impaired mitochondrial function in mutant neurons. Activation of AKT/mTOR signaling by exogenous growth factors or by depletion of PTEN boosted protein synthesis and ameliorated disease phenotypes in mutant neurons. Our findings indicate a vital function for MECP2 in maintaining active gene transcription in human neuronal cells.},

Still, how the properties of specific inhibitory neuron classes relate to their local circuits remains unclear. To better understand the distribution and origins of orientation selectivity in inhibitory neurons expressing the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV) in the mouse primary visual cortex, we labeled PV(+) neurons with red fluorescent protein (RFP) and targeted them for cell-attached electrophysiological recordings. PV(+) neurons could be broadly tuned or sharply tuned for orientation but tended to be more broadly tuned than unlabeled neurons on average. The dendritic morphology of PV(+) cells, revealed by intracellular labeling, was strongly correlated with tuning: highly tuned PV(+) neurons had shorter dendrites that branched nearer to the soma and had smaller dendritic fields overall, whereas broadly tuned PV(+) neurons had longer dendrites that branched farther from the soma, producing larger dendritic fields. High-speed two-photon calcium imaging of visual responses showed that the orientation preferences of highly tuned PV(+) neurons resembled the preferred orientations of neighboring cells. These results suggest that the diversity of the local neighborhood and the nature of dendritic sampling may both contribute to the response selectivity of PV(+) neurons.},

We use straightforward optics to lock onto networks in vivo, to steer light to activate circuit elements and to simultaneously record from other cells. We then actualize this 'free' augmentation on both an 'open' two-photon microscope and a leading commercial one. By following this protocol, setup of the system takes a few days, and the result is a noninvasive interface to brain dynamics based on directed light, at a network resolution that was not previously possible and which will further improve with the rapid advance in development of optical reporters and effectors. This protocol is for physiologists who are competent with computers and wish to extend hardware and software to interface more fluidly with neuronal networks.},

  abstract        = {A major challenge for understanding neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), is to advance the findings from gene discovery to an exposition of neurobiological mechanisms that underlie these disorders and subsequently translate this knowledge into mechanism-based therapeutics. A promising way to proceed is revealed by the recent studies of rare subsets of ASDs. In this review, we summarize the latest advances in the mechanisms and emerging therapeutics for a rare single-gene ASD, Rett syndrome. Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene coding for methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Although MeCP2 has diverse functions, examination of MeCP2 mutant mice suggests the hypothesis that MeCP2 deficiency leads to aberrant maturation and maintenance of synapses and circuits in multiple brain systems. Some of the deficits arise from alterations in specific intracellular pathways such as the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. These abnormalities can be at least partially rescued in MeCP2 mutant mice by treatment with therapeutic agents. Mechanism-based therapeutics are emerging for single-gene neurodevelopmental disorders such as Rett syndrome. Given the complexity of MeCP2 function, future directions include combination therapeutics that target multiple molecules and pathways. Such approaches will likely be applicable to other ASDs as well.},

In many species, the inputs that represent the eyes are segregated into ocular dominance columns in primary visual cortex (V1), whereas in rodents, this does not occur. Ten-m3, a member of the Ten-m/Odz/Teneurin family, regulates axonal guidance in the retinogeniculate pathway. Significantly, ipsilateral projections are expanded in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and are not aligned with contralateral projections in Ten-m3 knockout (KO) mice. Here, we demonstrate the impact of altered retinogeniculate mapping on the organization and function of V1. Transneuronal tracing and c-fos immunohistochemistry demonstrate that the subcortical expansion of ipsilateral input is conveyed to V1 in Ten-m3 KOs: Ipsilateral inputs are widely distributed across V1 and are interdigitated with contralateral inputs into eye dominance domains. Segregation is confirmed by optical imaging of intrinsic signals. Single-unit recording shows ipsilateral, and contralateral inputs are mismatched at the level of single V1 neurons, and binocular stimulation leads to functional suppression of these cells. These findings indicate that the medial expansion of the binocular zone together with an interocular mismatch is sufficient to induce novel structural features, such as eye dominance domains in rodent visual cortex.},

Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that plasticity in both the developing and adult visual cortex is initiated by a transient reduction of inhibitory drive, and implemented by persistent changes at excitatory synapses. Developmental plasticity may be induced by alterations in the balance of activity from the two eyes and is implemented by a cascade of signals that lead to feedforward and feedback changes at synapses. Adult plasticity is imposed on mature synapses and requires additional neurotransmitter-dependent mechanisms that alter inhibition and subsequently response gain.},

We further show with in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, ex vivo calcium imaging, and whole-cell recordings that this pairing-induced potentiation is mediated by direct cholinergic activation of primary visual cortex astrocytes via muscarinic AChRs. The potentiation is absent in conditional inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate receptor type 2 KO mice, which lack astrocyte calcium activation, and is stimulus-specific, because pairing NB stimulation with a specific visual orientation reveals a highly selective potentiation of responses to the paired orientation compared with unpaired orientations. Collectively, these findings reveal a unique and surprising role for astrocytes in NB-induced stimulus-specific plasticity in the cerebral cortex.},

Revealing their interplay requires activating specific cells while monitoring others in a functioning circuit. Here we use a new platform for two-way light-based circuit interrogation in visual cortex in vivo to show the computational implications of modulating different subclasses of inhibitory neurons during sensory processing. We find that soma-targeting, parvalbumin-expressing (PV) neurons principally divide responses but preserve stimulus selectivity, whereas dendrite-targeting, somatostatin-expressing (SOM) neurons principally subtract from excitatory responses and sharpen selectivity. Visualized in vivo cell-attached recordings show that division by PV neurons alters response gain, whereas subtraction by SOM neurons shifts response levels. Finally, stimulating identified neurons while scanning many target cells reveals that single PV and SOM neurons functionally impact only specific subsets of neurons in their projection fields. These findings provide direct evidence that inhibitory neuronal subclasses have distinct and complementary roles in cortical computations.},

Genetic and environmental insults lead to neurodevelopmental disorders which encompass a large group of diseases that result from anatomical and physiological abnormalities during maturation and development of brain circuits. Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurological disorder of genetic origin, caused by mutations in the X-linked gene methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). It features a range of neuropsychiatric abnormalities including motor dysfunctions and mild to severe cognitive impairment. Here, we discuss key questions and recent studies describing animal models, cell-type specific functions of methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), defects in neural circuit plasticity, and attempts to evaluate possible therapeutic strategies for RTT. We also discuss how genes, proteins, and overlapping signaling pathways affect the molecular etiology of apparently unrelated neuropsychiatric disorders, an understanding of which can offer novel therapeutic strategies for a range of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).},

There are currently few benchmarks for assessing quality. Here we show that X-inactivation markers can be used to separate hiPSC lines into distinct epigenetic classes and that the classes are phenotypically distinct. Loss of XIST expression is strongly correlated with upregulation of X-linked oncogenes, accelerated growth rate in vitro, and poorer differentiation in vivo. Whereas differences in X-inactivation potential result in epigenetic variability of female hiPSC lines, male hiPSC lines generally resemble each other and do not overexpress the oncogenes. Neither physiological oxygen levels nor HDAC inhibitors offer advantages to culturing female hiPSC lines. We conclude that female hiPSCs may be epigenetically less stable in culture and caution that loss of XIST may result in qualitatively less desirable stem cell lines.},

The contribution of specific interneuron classes to cortical circuits and emergent responses is unknown.

The V1 neurons examined in Dlx1(-/-) mice have reduced orientation selectivity and altered firing rates, with elevated late responses, suggesting that local inhibition at dendrites has a specific role in modulating neuronal computations. We did not detect overt changes in the physiological properties of thalamic relay neurons and features of thalamocortical projections, such as retinotopic maps and eye-specific inputs, in the mutant mice, suggesting that the defects are cortical in origin. These experimental results are well explained by a computational model that integrates broad tuning from dendrite-targeting and narrower tuning from soma-targeting interneuron subclasses. Our findings suggest a key role for DTIs in the fine-tuning of stimulus-specific cortical responses.},

We use degraded stimuli to tease apart the effects of bottom-up and top-down processes because they are easier to recognize with prior knowledge of undegraded images. Using machine learning algorithms, we quantify the amount of information that brain regions contain about stimuli as the subject learns the coherent images. Our results show that several distinct regions, including high-level visual areas and the retinotopic cortex, contain more information about degraded stimuli with prior knowledge. Critically, these regions are separate from those that exhibit classical priming, indicating that top-down influences are more than feature-based attention. Together, our results show how the neural processing of complex imagery is rapidly influenced by fleeting experiences.},

Neurons projecting to the posterior suprasylvian sulcus (PSS) were more direction selective and preferred shorter stimuli, higher spatial frequencies, and higher temporal frequencies than neurons projecting to area 21, anticipating key differences between the functional properties of the target areas themselves. These differences could not be explained by a correspondence between anatomical and functional clustering within early visual cortex, and the largest differences were in properties generated within early visual cortex (direction selectivity and length preference) rather than in properties present in its retinogeniculate inputs. These projection cell groups, and hence the higher-order visual areas to which they project, likely obtain their functional properties not from biased retinogeniculate inputs but from highly specific circuitry within the cortex.},

To relate these views, we measured activity in PPC while mice performed a virtual navigation task driven by visual decisions. PPC neurons were selective for specific combinations of the animal's spatial position and heading angle. This selectivity closely predicted both the activity of individual PPC neurons, and the arrangement of their collective firing patterns in choice-selective sequences. These sequences reflected PPC encoding of the animal's navigation trajectory. Using decision as a predictor instead of heading yielded worse fits, and using it in addition to heading only slightly improved the fits. Alternative models based on visual or motor variables were inferior. We conclude that when mice use vision to choose their trajectories, a large fraction of parietal cortex activity can be predicted from simple attributes such as spatial position and heading.},

  abstract     = {A major role of vision is to guide navigation, and navigation is strongly driven by vision . Indeed, the brain's visual and navigational systems are known to interact , and signals related to position in the environment have been suggested to appear as early as in the visual cortex . Here, to establish the nature of these signals, we recorded in the primary visual cortex (V1) and hippocampal area CA1 while mice traversed a corridor in virtual reality. The corridor contained identical visual landmarks in two positions, so that a purely visual neuron would respond similarly at those positions. Most V1 neurons, however, responded solely or more strongly to the landmarks in one position rather than the other. This modulation of visual responses by spatial location was not explained by factors such as running speed. To assess whether the modulation is related to navigational signals and to the animal's subjective estimate of position, we trained the mice to lick for a water reward upon reaching a reward zone in the corridor. Neuronal populations in both CA1 and V1 encoded the animal's position along the corridor, and the errors in their representations were correlated. Moreover, both representations reflected the animal's subjective estimate of position, inferred from the animal's licks, better than its actual position. When animals licked in a given location-whether correctly or incorrectly-neural populations in both V1 and CA1 placed the animal in the reward zone. We conclude that visual responses in V1 are controlled by navigational signals, which are coherent with those encoded in hippocampus and reflect the animal's subjective position. The presence of such navigational signals as early as a primary sensory area suggests that they permeate sensory processing in the cortex.},

To study the circuit underlying such interactions, we imaged these four types of cells in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). Our recordings in darkness were consistent with a "disinhibitory" model in which locomotion activates Vip cells, thus inhibiting Sst cells and disinhibiting Pyr cells. However, the disinhibitory model failed when visual stimuli were present: locomotion increased Sst cell responses to large stimuli and Vip cell responses to small stimuli. A recurrent network model successfully predicted each cell type's activity from the measured activity of other types. Capturing the effects of locomotion, however, required allowing it to increase feedforward synaptic weights and modulate recurrent weights. This network model summarizes interneuron interactions and suggests that locomotion may alter cortical computation by changing effective synaptic connectivity.},

  abstract        = {Sensory, motor and cognitive operations involve the coordinated action of large neuronal populations across multiple brain regions in both superficial and deep structures. Existing extracellular probes record neural activity with excellent spatial and temporal (sub-millisecond) resolution, but from only a few dozen neurons per shank. Optical Ca  imaging offers more coverage but lacks the temporal resolution needed to distinguish individual spikes reliably and does not measure local field potentials. Until now, no technology compatible with use in unrestrained animals has combined high spatiotemporal resolution with large volume coverage. Here we design, fabricate and test a new silicon probe known as Neuropixels to meet this need. Each probe has 384 recording channels that can programmably address 960 complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processing-compatible low-impedance TiN sites that tile a single 10-mm long, 70 × 20-μm cross-section shank. The 6 × 9-mm probe base is fabricated with the shank on a single chip. Voltage signals are filtered, amplified, multiplexed and digitized on the base, allowing the direct transmission of noise-free digital data from the probe. The combination of dense recording sites and high channel count yielded well-isolated spiking activity from hundreds of neurons per probe implanted in mice and rats. Using two probes, more than 700 well-isolated single neurons were recorded simultaneously from five brain structures in an awake mouse. The fully integrated functionality and small size of Neuropixels probes allowed large populations of neurons from several brain structures to be recorded in freely moving animals. This combination of high-performance electrode technology and scalable chip fabrication methods opens a path towards recording of brain-wide neural activity during behaviour.},

Here we report aberrant electrical activity, similar to interictal spikes, and accompanying fluorescence events in some genotypes of transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6 genetically encoded calcium sensors. These epileptiform events have been observed particularly, but not exclusively, in mice with Emx1-Cre and Ai93 transgenes, of either sex, across multiple laboratories. The events occur at >0.1 Hz, are very large in amplitude (>1.0 mV local field potentials, >10% df/f widefield imaging signals), and typically cover large regions of cortex. Many properties of neuronal responses and behavior seem normal despite these events, although rare subjects exhibit overt generalized seizures. The underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon remain unclear, but we speculate about possible causes on the basis of diverse observations. We encourage researchers to be aware of these activity patterns while interpreting neuronal recordings from affected mouse lines and when considering which lines to study.},

Here, we introduce high-yield methods for probing mouse visual decisions. Mice are head-fixed, facilitating repeatable visual stimulation, eye tracking, and brain access. They turn a steering wheel to make two alternative choices, forced or unforced. Learning is rapid thanks to intuitive coupling of stimuli to wheel position. The mouse decisions deliver high-quality psychometric curves for detection and discrimination and conform to the predictions of a simple probabilistic observer model. The task is readily paired with two-photon imaging of cortical activity. Optogenetic inactivation reveals that the task requires mice to use their visual cortex. Mice are motivated to perform the task by fluid reward or optogenetic stimulation of dopamine neurons. This stimulation elicits a larger number of trials and faster learning. These methods provide a platform to accurately probe mouse vision and its neural basis.},

We pharmacologically induced focal seizures in primary visual cortex (V1) of awake mice, and compared their propagation to the retinotopic organization of V1 and higher visual areas. We used simultaneous local field potential recordings and widefield imaging of a genetically encoded calcium indicator to measure prolonged seizures (ictal events) and brief interictal events. Both types of event are orders of magnitude larger than normal visual responses, and both start as standing waves: synchronous elevated activity in the V1 focus and in homotopic locations in higher areas, i.e. locations with matching retinotopic preference. Following this common beginning, however, seizures persist and propagate both locally and into homotopic distal regions, and eventually invade all of visual cortex and beyond. We conclude that seizure initiation resembles the initiation of interictal events, and seizure propagation respects the connectivity underlying normal visual processing.Focal cortical seizures result from local and widespread propagation of excitatory activity. Here the authors employ widefield calcium imaging in mouse visual areas to demonstrate that these seizures start as local synchronous activation and then propagate along the connectivity that underlies normal sensory processing.},

We found that hemodynamic activity can be expressed as the sum of two components, one local and one global. The local component reflected presumed neural signals driven by visual stimuli in the appropriate retinotopic region. The global component constituted large fluctuations shared by larger cortical regions, which extend beyond visual cortex. These fluctuations varied from trial to trial, but they did not constitute noise; they correlated with pupil diameter, suggesting that they reflect variations in arousal or alertness. Distinguishing local and global contributions to hemodynamic activity may help understand neurovascular coupling and interpret measurements of hemodynamic responses.},

Consistent with previous observations, we found that human choices are influenced by the success or failure of past choices even in a standard two-alternative detection task, where choice history is irrelevant. The typical bias was one that made the subject switch choices after a failure. These choice history biases led to poorer performance and were similar for observers in different countries. They were well captured by a simple logistic regression model that had been previously applied to describe psychophysical performance in mice. Such irrational biases seem at odds with the principles of reinforcement learning, which would predict exquisite adaptability to choice history. We therefore asked whether subjects could adapt their irrational biases following changes in trial order statistics. Adaptability was strong in the direction that confirmed a subject's default biases, but weaker in the opposite direction, so that existing biases could not be eradicated. We conclude that humans can adapt choice history biases, but cannot easily overcome existing biases even if irrational in the current context: adaptation is more sensitive to confirmatory than contradictory statistics.},

  abstract        = {The responses of cortical neurons to repeated presentation of a stimulus are highly variable, yet correlated. These "noise correlations" reflect a low-dimensional structure of population dynamics. Here, we examine noise correlations in 22,705 pairs of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) of anesthetized cats, during ongoing activity and in response to artificial and natural visual stimuli. We measured how noise correlations depend on 11 factors. Because these factors are themselves not independent, we distinguished their influences using a nonlinear additive model. The model revealed that five key factors play a predominant role in determining pairwise correlations. Two of these are distance in cortex and difference in sensory tuning: these are known to decrease correlation. A third factor is firing rate: confirming most earlier observations, it markedly increased pairwise correlations. A fourth factor is spike width: cells with a broad spike were more strongly correlated amongst each other. A fifth factor is spike isolation: neurons with worse isolation were more correlated, even if they were recorded on different electrodes. For pairs of neurons with poor isolation, this last factor was the main determinant of correlations. These results were generally independent of stimulus type and timescale of analysis, but there were exceptions. For instance, pairwise correlations depended on difference in orientation tuning more during responses to gratings than to natural stimuli. These results consolidate disjoint observations in a vast literature on pairwise correlations and point towards regularities of population coding in sensory cortex.},

However, current approaches for this are still limited in functionality and specificity. Here we utilize several intersectional strategies to generate multiple transgenic mouse lines expressing high levels of novel genetic tools with high specificity. We developed driver and double reporter mouse lines and viral vectors using the Cre/Flp and Cre/Dre double recombinase systems and established a new, retargetable genomic locus, TIGRE, which allowed the generation of a large set of Cre/tTA-dependent reporter lines expressing fluorescent proteins, genetically encoded calcium, voltage, or glutamate indicators, and optogenetic effectors, all at substantially higher levels than before. High functionality was shown in example mouse lines for GCaMP6, YCX2.60, VSFP Butterfly 1.2, and Jaws. These novel transgenic lines greatly expand the ability to monitor and manipulate neuronal activities with increased specificity.},

  abstract        = {The response of neurons in sensory cortex to repeated stimulus presentations is highly variable. To investigate the nature of this variability, we compared the spike activity of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of cats with that of their afferents from lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), in response to similar stimuli. We found variability to be much higher in V1 than in LGN. To investigate the sources of the additional variability, we measured the spiking activity of large V1 populations and found that much of the variability was shared across neurons: the variable portion of the responses of one neuron could be well predicted from the summed activity of the rest of the neurons. Variability thus mostly reflected global fluctuations affecting all neurons. The size and prevalence of these fluctuations, both in responses to stimuli and in ongoing activity, depended on cortical state, being larger in synchronized states than in more desynchronized states. Contrary to previous reports, these fluctuations invested the overall population, regardless of preferred orientation. The global fluctuations substantially increased variability in single neurons and correlations among pairs of neurons. Once this effect was removed, pairwise correlations were reduced and were similar regardless of cortical state. These results highlight the importance of cortical state in controlling cortical operation and can help reconcile previous studies, which differed widely in their estimate of neuronal variability and pairwise correlations.},

Here we test a promising GEVI in mouse cortex during wakefulness, a challenging condition due to large hemodynamic activity, and we introduce a straightforward projection method to separate a signal dominated by membrane voltage from a signal dominated by hemodynamic activity. We expressed VSFP-Butterfly 1.2 plasmid in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells of visual cortex through electroporation in utero. We then used wide-field imaging with two cameras to measure both fluorophores of the indicator in response to visual stimuli. By taking weighted sums and differences of the two measurements, we obtained clear separation of hemodynamic and voltage signals. The hemodynamic signal showed strong heartbeat oscillations, superimposed on slow dynamics similar to blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) or "intrinsic" signals. The voltage signal had fast dynamics similar to neural responses measured electrically, and showed an orderly retinotopic mapping. We compared this voltage signal with calcium signals imaged in transgenic mice that express a calcium indicator (GCaMP3) throughout cortex. The voltage signal from VSFP had similar signal-to-noise ratios as the calcium signal, it was more immune to vascular artifacts, and it integrated over larger regions of visual space, which was consistent with its reporting mostly subthreshold activity rather than the spiking activity revealed by calcium signals. These results demonstrate that GEVIs provide a powerful tool to study the dynamics of neural populations at mesoscopic spatial scales in the awake cortex.},

We measured spatially selective adaptation at two successive stages in the mouse visual system: visual thalamus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1). This form of adaptation affected both stages but in drastically different ways: in LGN it only changed response gain, while in V1 it also shifted spatial tuning away from the adaptor. These effects, however, are reconciled by a simple model whereby V1 neurons summate LGN inputs with a fixed, unadaptable weighting profile. These results indicate that adaptation effects cascade through the visual system, that this cascading can shape selectivity, and that the rules of integration from one stage to the next are not themselves adaptable.},

To investigate this relationship, we used optical imaging in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). Hemodynamic responses yielded clear maps of retinotopy in both anesthetized and awake mice. However, during wakefulness, responses were four times larger and twice as fast. These differences held whether we induced anesthesia with urethane or isoflurane and whether awake mice were stationary or running on a treadmill. With electrode recordings, we established that the effects of wakefulness reflect changes in neurovascular coupling, not in neural activity. By activating V1 directly via optogenetics, we replicated the effects of wakefulness in terms of timing but not of amplitude. We conclude that neurovascular coupling depends critically on anesthesia and wakefulness: during wakefulness, neural activity is followed by much stronger and quicker hemodynamic responses.},

  abstract        = {Cortical circuits encode sensory stimuli through the firing of neuronal ensembles, and also produce spontaneous population patterns in the absence of sensory drive. This population activity is often characterized experimentally by the distribution of multineuron "words" (binary firing vectors), and a match between spontaneous and evoked word distributions has been suggested to reflect learning of a probabilistic model of the sensory world. We analyzed multineuron word distributions in sensory cortex of anesthetized rats and cats, and found that they are dominated by fluctuations in population firing rate rather than precise interactions between individual units. Furthermore, cortical word distributions change when brain state shifts, and similar behavior is seen in simulated networks with fixed, random connectivity. Our results suggest that similarity or dissimilarity in multineuron word distributions could primarily reflect similarity or dissimilarity in population firing rate dynamics, and not necessarily the precise interactions between neurons that would indicate learning of sensory features.},

We contributed to this body of work by measuring the spike-triggered average of the local field potential (stLFP) at multiple concurrent locations (Nauhaus et al., 2009) in the visual cortex of anesthetized cats and macaques. We found the stLFP to be progressively delayed at increasing distances from the site of the triggering spikes, and interpreted this as a traveling wave of depolarization originating from that site. Our results were criticized, however, on two grounds. First, a study using the same recording techniques in the visual cortex of awake macaques reported an apparent lack of traveling waves, and proposed that traveling waves could arise artifactually from excessive filtering of the field potentials (Ray and Maunsell, 2011). Second, the interpretability of the stLFP was questioned (Kenneth Miller, personal communication), as the stLFP must reflect not only interactions between spike trains and field potentials, but also correlations within and across the spike trains. Here, we show that our data and interpretation are not imperiled by these criticisms. We reanalyzed our field potentials to remove any possible artifact due to filtering and to discount the effects of correlations within and across the triggering spike trains. In both cases, we found that the traveling waves were still present. In fact, closer inspection of Ray and Maunsell's (2011) data from awake cortex shows that they do agree with ours, as they contain clear evidence for traveling waves.},

To relate such circuits to perception, one must measure visually guided behavior and ask how it depends on fundamental stimulus attributes such as visual contrast. Using operant conditioning, we trained mice to detect visual contrast in a two-alternative forced-choice task. After 3-4 weeks of training, mice performed hundreds of trials in each session. Numerous sessions yielded high-quality psychometric curves from which we inferred measures of contrast sensitivity. In multiple sessions, however, choices were influenced not only by contrast, but also by estimates of reward value and by irrelevant factors such as recent failures and rewards. This behavior was captured by a generalized linear model involving not only the visual responses to the current stimulus but also a bias term and history terms depending on the outcome of the previous trial. We compared the behavioral performance of the mice to predictions of a simple decoder applied to neural responses measured in primary visual cortex of awake mice during passive viewing. The decoder performed better than the animal, suggesting that mice might not use optimally the information contained in the activity of visual cortex.},

To test these proposals, we recorded in cat primary visual cortex (V1) after local iontophoresis of gabazine, the selective GABA(A) antagonist. Gabazine increased responsiveness by as much as 300%. It slightly decreased selectivity for stimulus orientation and direction, often by raising responses to all orientations. Strikingly, gabazine affected neither contrast sensitivity nor cross-orientation suppression, the competition seen when stimuli of different orientation are superimposed. These results were captured by a simple model in which GABA(A) inhibition has the same selectivity as excitation and keeps responses to unwanted stimuli below threshold. We conclude that GABA(A) inhibition in V1 helps enhance stimulus selectivity but is not responsible for competition among superimposed stimuli. It controls the sensitivity of V1 neurons by adjusting their response gain, without affecting their input gain.},

When the contrasts were similar, the population performed an approximately equal summation. When the contrasts differed markedly, however, the population performed approximately a winner-take-all competition. Stimuli that were intermediate to these extremes elicited intermediate responses. This entire range of behaviors was explained by a single model of contrast normalization. Normalization captured both the spike responses and the local field potential responses; it even predicted visually evoked currents source-localized to V1 in human subjects. Normalization has profound effects on V1 population responses and is likely to shape the interpretation of these responses by higher cortical areas.},

We measured membrane potentials and spikes from neuronal populations in cat visual cortex (V1) using voltage-sensitive dyes and electrode arrays. We first characterized the population response to a single orientation. As response amplitude grew, the population tuning width remained constant for membrane potential responses and became progressively sharper for spike responses. We then asked how these single-orientation responses combine to code for successive orientations. We found that they combined through simple linear summation. Linearity, however, was violated after stimulus offset, when responses exhibited an unexplained persistence. As a result of linearity, the interactions between responses to successive stimuli were minimal. Our results indicate that higher cortical areas may reconstruct the stimulus sequence from V1 population responses through a simple instantaneous decoder. Therefore, spatial and temporal codes in area V1 operate largely independently.},

An ideal testbed for such models is the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Mechanisms shaping LGN responses include the linear receptive field and two fast adaptation processes, sensitive to luminance and contrast. We propose a compact functional model for these mechanisms that operates on sequences of arbitrary images. With the same parameters that fit the firing rate responses to simple stimuli, it predicts the bulk of the firing rate responses to complex stimuli, including natural scenes. Further improvements could result by adding a spiking mechanism, possibly one capable of bursts, but not by adding mechanisms of slow adaptation. We conclude that up to the LGN the responses to natural scenes can be largely explained through insights gained with simple artificial stimuli.},

  abstract        = {The organization of primary visual cortex (V1) into functional maps makes individual cells operate in a variety of contexts. For instance, some neurons lie in regions of fairly homogeneous orientation preference (iso-orientation domains), while others lie in regions with a variety of preferences (e.g., pinwheel centers). We asked whether this diversity in local map structure correlates with the degree of selectivity of spike responses. We used a combination of imaging and electrophysiology to reveal that neurons in regions of homogeneous orientation preference have much sharper tuning. Moreover, in both monkeys and cats, a common principle links the structure of the orientation map, on the spatial scale of dendritic integration, to the degree of selectivity of individual cells. We conclude that neural computation is not invariant across the cortical surface. This finding must factor into future theories of receptive field wiring and map development.},

Our knowledge of the connectivity pattern underlying this inhibitory network is, however, still incomplete. Here we describe a simple and complementary interaction scheme between three large, molecularly distinct interneuron populations in mouse visual cortex: parvalbumin-expressing interneurons strongly inhibit one another but provide little inhibition to other populations. In contrast, somatostatin-expressing interneurons avoid inhibiting one another yet strongly inhibit all other populations. Finally, vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing interneurons preferentially inhibit somatostatin-expressing interneurons. This scheme occurs in supragranular and infragranular layers, suggesting that inhibitory networks operate similarly at the input and output of the visual cortex. Thus, as the specificity of connections between excitatory neurons forms the basis for the cortical canonical circuit, the scheme described here outlines a standard connectivity pattern among cortical inhibitory neurons.},

However, the cellular mechanisms that enable cortical neurons to report accurate temporal information are not known. Here, we show that in the rodent barrel cortex, the temporal window for integration of thalamic inputs is under the control of thalamocortical feed-forward inhibition and can vary from 1 to 10 ms. A single thalamic fiber can trigger feed-forward inhibition and contacts both excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons. The dynamics of feed-forward inhibition exceed those of each individual synapse in the circuit and are captured by a simple disynaptic model of the thalamocortical projection. The variations in the integration window produce changes in the temporal precision of cortical responses to whisker stimulation. Hence, feed-forward inhibitory circuits, classically known to sharpen spatial contrast of tactile inputs, also increase the temporal resolution in the somatosensory cortex.},

Using Bayesian analysis and clustering algorithms on the resulting data, we investigated the suitability of several anatomical terms and neuron names for cortical GABAergic interneurons. Moreover, we show that supervised classification models could automatically categorize interneurons in agreement with experts' assignments. These results demonstrate a practical and objective approach to the naming, characterization and classification of neurons based on community consensus.},

  abstract        = {Recurrent inhibitory loops are simple neuronal circuits found in the central nervous system, yet little is known about the physiological rules governing their activity. Here we use simultaneous somatic and dendritic recordings in rat hippocampal slices to show that during a series of action potentials in pyramidal cells recurrent inhibition rapidly shifts from their soma to the apical dendrites. Two distinct inhibitory circuits are sequentially recruited to produce this shift: one, time-locked with submillisecond precision to the onset of the action potential series, transiently inhibits the somatic and perisomatic regions of pyramidal cells; the other, activated in proportion to the rate of action potentials in the series, durably inhibits the distal apical dendrites. These two operating modes result from the synergy between pre- and postsynaptic properties of excitatory synapses onto recurrent inhibitory neurons with distinct projection patterns. Thus, the onset of a series of action potentials and the rate of action potentials in the series are selectively captured and transformed into different spatial patterns of recurrent inhibition.},

  abstract        = {The response of cortical neurons to a sensory stimulus is modulated by the context. In the visual cortex, for example, stimulation of a pyramidal cell's receptive-field surround can attenuate the cell's response to a stimulus in the centre of its receptive field, a phenomenon called surround suppression. Whether cortical circuits contribute to surround suppression or whether the phenomenon is entirely relayed from earlier stages of visual processing is debated. Here we show that, in contrast to pyramidal cells, the response of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons (SOMs) in the superficial layers of the mouse visual cortex increases with stimulation of the receptive-field surround. This difference results from the preferential excitation of SOMs by horizontal cortical axons. By perturbing the activity of SOMs, we show that these neurons contribute to pyramidal cells' surround suppression. These results establish a cortical circuit for surround suppression and attribute a particular function to a genetically defined type of inhibitory neuron.},

Because the amount of excitation varies, maintaining this balance is a dynamic process; yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We show here that the activity of even a single layer 2/3 pyramidal cell in the somatosensory cortex of the rat generates widespread inhibition that increases disproportionately with the number of active pyramidal neurons. This supralinear increase of inhibition results from the incremental recruitment of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory interneurons located in layers 2/3 and 5. The recruitment of these interneurons increases tenfold when they are excited by two pyramidal cells. A simple model demonstrates that the distribution of excitatory input amplitudes onto inhibitory neurons influences the sensitivity and dynamic range of the recurrent circuit. These data show that through a highly sensitive recurrent inhibitory circuit, cortical excitability can be modulated by one pyramidal cell.},

It is believed that through these projections layers can influence each other's response to sensory stimuli, but the specific role that each layer has in cortical processing is still poorly understood. Here we show that layer six in the primary visual cortex of the mouse has a crucial role in controlling the gain of visually evoked activity in neurons of the upper layers without changing their tuning to orientation. This gain modulation results from the coordinated action of layer six intracortical projections to superficial layers and deep projections to the thalamus, with a substantial role of the intracortical circuit. This study establishes layer six as a major mediator of cortical gain modulation and suggests that it could be a node through which convergent inputs from several brain areas can regulate the earliest steps of cortical visual processing.},

  abstract        = {The relationship between synaptic excitation and inhibition (E/I ratio), two opposing forces in the mammalian cerebral cortex, affects many cortical functions such as feature selectivity and gain. Individual pyramidal cells show stable E/I ratios in time despite fluctuating cortical activity levels. This is because when excitation increases, inhibition increases proportionally through the increased recruitment of inhibitory neurons, a phenomenon referred to as excitation-inhibition balance. However, little is known about the distribution of E/I ratios across pyramidal cells. Through their highly divergent axons, inhibitory neurons indiscriminately contact most neighbouring pyramidal cells. Is inhibition homogeneously distributed or is it individually matched to the different amounts of excitation received by distinct pyramidal cells? Here we discover that pyramidal cells in layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex each receive inhibition in a similar proportion to their excitation. As a consequence, E/I ratios are equalized across pyramidal cells. This matched inhibition is mediated by parvalbumin-expressing but not somatostatin-expressing inhibitory cells and results from the independent adjustment of synapses originating from individual parvalbumin-expressing cells targeting different pyramidal cells. Furthermore, this match is activity-dependent as it is disrupted by perturbing pyramidal cell activity. Thus, the equalization of E/I ratios across pyramidal cells reveals an unexpected degree of order in the spatial distribution of synaptic strengths and indicates that the relationship between the cortex's two opposing forces is stabilized not only in time but also in space.},

The amplitude and frequency of these oscillations are continuously modulated depending on stimulus and behavioral state. This modulation is believed to crucially control information flow across cortical areas. Here we report that in the rat hippocampus gamma oscillation amplitude and frequency vary rapidly, from one cycle to the next. Strikingly, the amplitude of one oscillation predicts the interval to the next. Using in vivo and in vitro whole-cell recordings, we identify the underlying mechanism. We show that cycle-by-cycle fluctuations in amplitude reflect changes in synaptic excitation spanning over an order of magnitude. Despite these rapid variations, synaptic excitation is immediately and proportionally counterbalanced by inhibition. These rapid adjustments in inhibition instantaneously modulate oscillation frequency. So, by rapidly balancing excitation with inhibition, the hippocampal network is able to swiftly modulate gamma oscillations over a wide band of frequencies.},

PV cells' impact on pyramidal cells is captured by a linear transformation, both additive and multiplicative, with a threshold.

Mice either deployed an active strategy-engaging their body toward the approaching texture-or passively awaited the touch. Independent of strategy, whisker-related posterior areas encoded choice early after touch. During the delay, in contrast, persistent cortical activity was located medio-frontally in active trials but in a lateral posterior area in passive trials. Perturbing these areas impaired performance for the associated strategy and also provoked strategy switches. Frontally maintained information related to future action, whereas activity in the posterior cortex reflected past stimulus identity. Thus, depending on behavioral strategy, cortical activity is routed differentially to hold information either frontally or posteriorly before converging to similar action.},

However, the basic relationship between its brain-wide axonal projections and functional dynamics is not known. Here we combine optogenetics and fMRI to produce a brain-wide 5-HT evoked functional map. We find that DRN photostimulation leads to an increase in the hemodynamic response in the DRN itself, while projection areas predominately exhibit a reduction of cerebral blood volume mirrored by suppression of cortical delta oscillations. We find that the regional distribution of post-synaptically expressed 5-HT receptors better correlates with DRN 5-HT functional connectivity than anatomical projections. Our work suggests that neuroarchitecture is not the primary determinant of function for the DRN 5-HT. With respect to two 5-HT elevating stimuli, we find that acute stress leads to circuit-wide blunting of the DRN output, while the SSRI fluoxetine noticeably enhances DRN functional connectivity. These data provide fundamental insight into the brain-wide functional dynamics of the 5-HT projection system.},

Although TSEs can be experimentally transmitted by intracerebral inoculation, most instances of infection in the field occur through extracerebral routes. The epidemics of kuru and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease were caused by dietary exposure to prions, and parenteral administration of prion-contaminated hormones has caused hundreds of iatrogenic TSEs. In all these instances, the development of postexposure prophylaxis relies on understanding of how prions propagate from the site of entry to the brain. While much evidence points to lymphoreticular invasion followed by retrograde transfer through peripheral nerves, prions are present in the blood and may conceivably cross the blood-brain barrier directly. Here we have addressed the role of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in prion disease propagation using Pdgfbret/ret mice which possess a highly permeable BBB. We found that Pdgfbret/ret mice have a similar prion disease incubation time as their littermate controls regardless of the route of prion transmission. These surprising results indicate that BBB permeability is irrelevant to the initiation of prion disease, even when prions are administered parenterally.},

  abstract        = {Local excitatory connections in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) are stronger and more prevalent between neurons that share similar functional response features. However, the details of how functional rules for local connectivity shape neuronal responses in V1 remain unknown. We hypothesised that complex responses to visual stimuli may arise as a consequence of rules for selective excitatory connectivity within the local network in the superficial layers of mouse V1. In mouse V1 many neurons respond to overlapping grating stimuli (plaid stimuli) with highly selective and facilitatory responses, which are not simply predicted by responses to single gratings presented alone. This complexity is surprising, since excitatory neurons in V1 are considered to be mainly tuned to single preferred orientations. Here we examined the consequences for visual processing of two alternative connectivity schemes: in the first case, local connections are aligned with visual properties inherited from feedforward input (a 'like-to-like' scheme specifically connecting neurons that share similar preferred orientations); in the second case, local connections group neurons into excitatory subnetworks that combine and amplify multiple feedforward visual properties (a 'feature binding' scheme). By comparing predictions from large scale computational models with in vivo recordings of visual representations in mouse V1, we found that responses to plaid stimuli were best explained by assuming feature binding connectivity. Unlike under the like-to-like scheme, selective amplification within feature-binding excitatory subnetworks replicated experimentally observed facilitatory responses to plaid stimuli; explained selective plaid responses not predicted by grating selectivity; and was consistent with broad anatomical selectivity observed in mouse V1. Our results show that visual feature binding can occur through local recurrent mechanisms without requiring feedforward convergence, and that such a mechanism is consistent with visual responses and cortical anatomy in mouse V1.},

Here we examined the neuronal correlates of an auditory-tactile stimulus sequence in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) using 2-photon calcium imaging in awake mice. We find that neuronal subpopulations in layer 2/3 of PPC reliably represent texture-touch events, in addition to auditory cues that presage the incoming tactile stimulus. Notably, altering the flow of sensory events through omission of the cued texture touch elicited large responses in a subset of neurons hardly responsive to or even inhibited by the tactile stimuli. Hence, PPC neurons were able to discriminate not only tactile stimulus features (i.e., texture graininess) but also between the presence and omission of the texture stimulus. Whereas some of the neurons responsive to texture omission were driven by looming-like auditory sounds others became recruited only with tactile sensory experience. These findings indicate that layer 2/3 neuronal populations in PPC potentially encode correlates of expectancy in addition to auditory and tactile stimuli.},

This protocol describes a technique for simultaneous measurement of neural activity using fluorescent calcium indicators together with the corresponding hemodynamic BOLD fMRI response in the mouse brain. Our early work using small-molecule fluorophores in rats gave encouraging results but was limited to acute measurements using synthetic dyes. Our latest procedure combines fMRI with optical detection of cell-type-specific virally delivered GCaMP6, a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI). GCaMP6 fluorescence, which increases upon calcium binding, is collected by a chronically implanted optical fiber, allowing longitudinal studies in mice. The chronic implant, placed horizontally on the skull, has an angulated tip that reflects light into the brain and is connected via fiber optics to a remote optical setup. The technique allows access to the neocortex and does not require adaptations of commercial MRI hardware. The hybrid approach permits fiber-optic calcium recordings with simultaneous artifact-free BOLD fMRI with full brain coverage and 1-s temporal resolution using standard gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (GE-EPI) sequences. The method provides robust, cell-type-specific readouts to link neural activity to BOLD signals, as emonstrated for task-free ('resting-state') conditions and in response to hind-paw stimulation. These results highlight the power of fiber photometry combined with fMRI, which we aim to further advance in this protocol. The approach can be easily adapted to study other molecular processes using suitable fluorescent indicators.},

Further, our data reveal unexpected asymmetric divisions of nonradial glia-like NSPCs. Cell fates of Ascl1-labeled lineages suggest a developmental-like program involving a sequential transition from a proliferative to a neurogenic phase. By providing a comprehensive description of lineage relationships, from dividing NSPCs to newborn neurons integrating into the hippocampal circuitry, our data offer insight into how NSPCs support life-long hippocampal neurogenesis.},

Event cameras can provide higher dynamic range (DR) and reduce data rate and latency, but most existing event cameras have limited sensitivity. This paper presents the results of a 180-nm Towerjazz CIS process vision sensor called SDAVIS192. It outputs temporal contrast dynamic vision sensor (DVS) events and conventional active pixel sensor frames. The SDAVIS192 improves on previous DAVIS sensors with higher sensitivity for temporal contrast. The temporal contrast thresholds can be set down to 1% for negative changes in logarithmic intensity (OFF events) and down to 3.5% for positive changes (ON events). The achievement is possible through the adoption of an in-pixel preamplification stage. This preamplifier reduces the effective intrascene DR of the sensor (70 dB for OFF and 50 dB for ON), but an automated operating region control allows up to at least 110-dB DR for OFF events. A second contribution of this paper is the development of characterization methodology for measuring DVS event detection thresholds by incorporating a measure of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). At average SNR of 30 dB, the DVS temporal contrast threshold fixed pattern noise is measured to be 0.3%-0.8% temporal contrast. Results comparing monochrome and RGBW color filter array DVS events are presented. The higher sensitivity of SDAVIS192 make this sensor potentially useful for calcium imaging, as shown in a recording from cultured neurons expressing calcium sensitive green fluorescent protein GCaMP6f.},

  abstract        = {A fundamental task frequently encountered by brains is to rapidly and reliably discriminate between sensory stimuli of the same modality, be it distinct auditory sounds, odors, visual patterns, or tactile textures. A key mammalian brain structure involved in discrimination behavior is the neocortex. Sensory processing not only involves the respective primary sensory area, which is crucial for perceptual detection, but additionally relies on cortico-cortical communication among several regions including higher-order sensory areas as well as frontal cortical areas. It remains elusive how these regions exchange information to process neural representations of distinct stimuli to bring about a decision and initiate appropriate behavioral responses. Likewise, it is poorly understood how these neural computations are conjured during task learning. In this review, we discuss recent studies investigating cortical dynamics during discrimination behaviors that utilize head-fixed behavioral tasks in combination with in vivo electrophysiology, two-photon calcium imaging, and cell-type-specific targeting. We particularly focus on information flow in distinct cortico-cortical pathways when mice use their whiskers to discriminate between different objects or different locations. Within the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (S1 and S2, respectively) as well as vibrissae motor cortex (M1), intermingled functional representations of touch, whisking, and licking were found, which partially re-organized during discrimination learning. These findings provide first glimpses of cortico-cortical communication but emphasize that for understanding the complete process of discrimination it will be crucial to elucidate the details of how neural processing is coordinated across brain-wide neuronal networks including the S1-S2-M1 triangle and cortical areas beyond.},

The functional adaptations of neocortical circuitry during this developmental period remain poorly understood. Here, we characterized stimulus-evoked neuronal activity across all layers of mouse barrel cortex before, during, and after the onset of whisking behavior. Employing multi-electrode recordings and 2-photon calcium imaging in anesthetized mice, we tested responses to rostro-caudal whisker deflections, axial "tapping" stimuli, and their combination from postnatal day 10 (P10) to P28. Within this period, whisker-evoked activity of neurons displayed a general decrease in layer 2/3 (L2/3) and L4, but increased in L5 and L6. Distinct alterations in neuronal response adaptation during the 2-s period of stimulation at ~5 Hz accompanied these changes. Moreover, single-unit analysis revealed that response selectivity in favor of either lateral deflection or axial tapping emerges in deeper layers within the critical period around P14. For superficial layers we confirmed this finding using calcium imaging of L2/3 neurons, which also exhibited emergence of response selectivity as well as progressive sparsification and decorrelation of evoked responses around P14. Our results demonstrate layer-specific development of sensory responsiveness and response selectivity in mouse somatosensory cortex coinciding with the onset of exploratory behavior.},

Among these signals, dendritic NMDA spikes are of interest in light of their correlation with synaptic LTP induction. Because it is not possible to block NMDA spikes pharmacologically while maintaining NMDA receptors available to initiate synaptic plasticity, it remains unclear whether NMDA spikes alone can trigger LTP. Here we use dendritic recordings and calcium imaging to analyse the role of NMDA spikes in associative LTP in CA3 pyramidal cells. We show that NMDA spikes produce regenerative branch-specific calcium transients. Decreasing the probability of NMDA spikes reduces LTP, whereas increasing their probability enhances LTP. NMDA spikes and LTP occur without back-propagating action potentials. However, action potentials can facilitate LTP induction by promoting NMDA spikes. Thus, NMDA spikes are necessary and sufficient to produce the critical postsynaptic depolarization required for associative LTP in CA3 pyramidal cells.},

In contrast to viral infection or in utero electroporation, indicator expression in transgenic reporter lines is induced noninvasively, reliably, and homogenously. Recently, Cre/tTA-dependent reporter mice were introduced, which provide high-level expression of green fluorescent GECIs in a cell-type-specific and inducible manner when crossed with Cre and tTA driver mice. Here, we generated and characterized the first red-shifted GECI reporter line of this type using R-CaMP1.07, a red fluorescent indicator that is efficiently two-photon excited above 1000 nm. By crossing the new R-CaMP1.07 reporter line to Cre lines driving layer-specific expression in neocortex we demonstrate its high fidelity for reporting action potential firing in vivo, long-term stability over months, and versatile use for functional imaging of excitatory neurons across all cortical layers, especially in the previously difficult to access layers 4 and 6.},

  abstract        = {The hippocampal dentate gyrus is critically involved in learning and memory. However, methods for imaging the activity of its principal neurons, the dentate gyrus granule cells, are missing. Here we demonstrate chronic two-photon imaging of granule cell population activity in awake mice using a cortical window implant that leaves the hippocampal formation intact and does not lead to obvious alteration of animal behavior. Using virus delivery, we targeted expression of genetically encoded calcium indicators specifically to dentate gyrus granule cells. Calcium imaging of granule cell activity 600-800 μm below the hippocampal surface was facilitated by using 1040 nm excitation of the red indicator R-CaMP1.07, but was also achieved using the green indicator GCaMP6s. We found that the rate of calcium transients was increased during wakefulness relative to an extremely low rate during anesthesia; however, activity still remained sparse with, on average, approximately one event per 2-5 min per cell across the granule cell population. Comparing periods of running on a ladder wheel and periods of resting, we furthermore identified state-dependent differences in the active granule cell population, with some cells displaying highest activity level during running and others during resting. Typically, cells did not maintain a clear state preference in their activity pattern across days. Our approach opens new avenues to elucidate granule cell function, plasticity mechanisms, and network computation in the adult dentate gyrus. We describe a technique that allows for chronic, functional imaging of dentate gyrus granule cells in awake, behaving mice in an intact hippocampal circuitry using genetically encoded calcium indicators. This novel approach enables the analyses of individual granule cell activity over time and provides a powerful tool to elucidate the mechanisms underlying structural and functional plasticity of the adult dentate gyrus.},

Most of our knowledge on adaptation in single cells is based on experiments in anesthetized animals. How responses adapt in awake animals, when stimuli may be behaviorally relevant or not, remains unclear. Here we show that contrast adaptation in mouse primary visual cortex depends on the behavioral relevance of the stimulus. Cells that adapted to contrast under anesthesia maintained or even increased their activity in awake naïve mice. When engaged in a visually guided task, contrast adaptation re-occurred for stimuli that were irrelevant for solving the task. However, contrast adaptation was reversed when stimuli acquired behavioral relevance. Regulation of cortical adaptation by task demand may allow dynamic control of sensory-evoked signal flow in the neocortex.},

Understanding this process requires simultaneous functional measurements across the cortex. In order to dissociate direct cortico-cortical interactions from other sources of neuronal correlations, it is furthermore desirable to target cross-areal recordings to neuronal subpopulations that anatomically project between areas. Here, we combined anatomical tracers with a novel multi-area two-photon microscope to perform simultaneous calcium imaging across mouse primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory whisker cortex during texture discrimination behavior, specifically identifying feedforward and feedback neurons. We find that coordination of S1-S2 activity increases during motor behaviors such as goal-directed whisking and licking. This effect was not specific to identified feedforward and feedback neurons. However, these mutually projecting neurons especially participated in inter-areal coordination when motor behavior was paired with whisker-texture touches, suggesting that direct S1-S2 interactions are sensory-dependent. Our results demonstrate specific functional coordination of anatomically-identified projection neurons across sensory cortices.},

RE(+) neurons convey information to the hippocampus, while CB(+) neurons project to the olfactory cortex and the olfactory bulb. In vivo calcium imaging revealed that RE(+) neurons responded with higher selectivity to specific odors than CB(+) neurons and GABAergic neurons. At the population level, odor discrimination was significantly better for RE(+) than CB(+) neurons, and was lowest for GABAergic neurons. Thus, we identified in LII of the LEC anatomically and functionally distinct neuronal subpopulations that engage differentially in feedforward and feedback signaling during odor processing.},

  abstract        = {A major challenge for sensory processing in the brain is considering stimulus context, such as stimulus probability, which may be relevant for survival. Excitatory neurons in auditory cortex, for example, adapt to repetitive tones in a stimulus-specific manner without fully generalizing to a low-probability deviant tone ("oddball") that breaks the preceding regularity. Whether such stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) also prevails in inhibitory neurons and how it might relate to deviance detection remains elusive. We obtained whole-cell recordings from excitatory neurons and somatostatin- and parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons in layer 2/3 of mouse auditory cortex and measured tone-evoked membrane potential responses. All cell types displayed SSA of fast ("early") subthreshold and suprathreshold responses with oddball tones of a deviant frequency eliciting enlarged responses compared with adapted standards. SSA was especially strong when oddball frequency matched neuronal preference. In addition, we identified a slower "late" response component (200-400 ms after tone onset), most clearly in excitatory and parvalbumin-positive neurons, which also displayed SSA. For excitatory neurons, this late component reflected genuine deviance detection. Moreover, intracellular blockade of NMDA receptors reduced early and late responses in excitatory but not parvalbumin-positive neurons. The late component in excitatory neurons thus shares time course, deviance detection, and pharmacological features with the deviant-evoked event-related potential known as mismatch negativity (MMN) and provides a potential link between neuronal SSA and MMN. In summary, our results suggest a two-phase cortical activation upon oddball stimulation, with oddball tones first reactivating the adapted auditory cortex circuitry and subsequently triggering delayed reverberating network activity. Significance statement: Understanding how the brain encodes sensory context in addition to stimulus feature has been a main focus in neuroscience. Using in vivo targeted whole-cell recordings from excitatory and inhibitory neurons of mouse primary auditory cortex, we report two temporally distinct components of membrane potential responses encoding oddball tones that break stimulus regularity. Both components display stimulus-specific adaptation upon oddball paradigm stimulation in the three recorded cell types. The late response component, in particular, carries signatures of genuine deviance detection. In excitatory but not parvalbumin-positive inhibitory neurons, both early and late components depend on NMDA receptor-signaling. Our work proposes a potential neuronal substrate of a known deviant-evoked event-related potential, which is of fundamental significance in basic and clinical neuroscience.},

We chronically imaged activity of S1 neurons projecting to secondary somatosensory (S2) or primary motor (M1) cortex in mice learning a texture discrimination task. Mice adopted an active whisking strategy that enhanced texture-related whisker kinematics, correlating with task performance. M1-projecting neurons reliably encoded basic kinematics features, and an additional subset of touch-related neurons was recruited that persisted past training. The number of S2-projecting touch neurons remained constant, but improved their discrimination of trial types through reorganization while developing activity patterns capable of discriminating the animal's decision. We propose that learning-related changes in S1 enhance sensory representations in a pathway-specific manner, providing downstream areas with task-relevant information for behavior.},

Cortical representation of periodic whisker deflections was studied in populations of neurons in supragranular layers over extended time periods (up to 3 months) with long-term two-photon Ca(2+) imaging in anesthetized mice. We found that in most of the neurons (87%), Ca(2+) responses increased sublinearly with increasing number of contralateral whisker deflections. The imaged population of neurons was activated in a stereotypic way over days and for different deflection rates (pulse frequencies). Thus, pulse frequencies are coded by response strength rather than by distinct neuronal sub-populations. A small population of highly responsive neurons (~3%) was sufficient to decode the whisker stimulus. This conserved functional map, led by a small set of highly responsive neurons, might form the foundation of stable sensory percepts.},

  abstract        = {Neurons in sensory areas of neocortex exhibit responses tuned to specific features of the environment. In visual cortex, information about features such as edges or textures with particular orientations must be integrated to recognize a visual scene or object. Connectivity studies in rodent cortex have revealed that neurons make specific connections within sub-networks sharing common input tuning. In principle, this sub-network architecture enables local cortical circuits to integrate sensory information. However, whether feature integration indeed occurs locally in rodent primary sensory areas has not been examined directly. We studied local integration of sensory features in primary visual cortex (V1) of the mouse by presenting drifting grating and plaid stimuli, while recording the activity of neuronal populations with two-photon calcium imaging. Using a Bayesian model-based analysis framework, we classified single-cell responses as being selective for either individual grating components or for moving plaid patterns. Rather than relying on trial-averaged responses, our model-based framework takes into account single-trial responses and can easily be extended to consider any number of arbitrary predictive models. Our analysis method was able to successfully classify significantly more responses than traditional partial correlation (PC) analysis, and provides a rigorous statistical framework to rank any number of models and reject poorly performing models. We also found a large proportion of cells that respond strongly to only one stimulus class. In addition, a quarter of selectively responding neurons had more complex responses that could not be explained by any simple integration model. Our results show that a broad range of pattern integration processes already take place at the level of V1. This diversity of integration is consistent with processing of visual inputs by local sub-networks within V1 that are tuned to combinations of sensory features.},

For example, it is unclear whether information about stimulus frequency is perturbed by adaptation or encoded by precise response timing. We addressed this question in rat barrel cortex by comparing performance in behavioral tasks with either whisker stimulation, which causes frequency-dependent adaptation, or optical activation of cortically expressed channelrhodopsin-2, which elicits non-adapting neural responses. Circumventing adaption by optical activation substantially improved cross-hemispheric discrimination of stimulus frequency. This improvement persisted when temporal precision of optically evoked spikes was reduced. We were able to replicate whisker-driven behavior only by applying adaptation rules mimicking sensory-evoked responses to optical stimuli. Conversely, in a change-detection task, animals performed better with whisker than optical stimulation. Our results directly demonstrate that sensory adaptation critically governs the perception of stimulus patterns, decreasing fidelity under steady-state conditions in favor of change detection.},

The model describes intracellular calcium handling under simplified conditions, for which analytical expressions for the amplitude and the time constants of [Ca(2+)]i changes can be explicitly derived. In particular, it reveals the dependence of the measured [Ca(2+)]i changes on the calcium indicator concentration. Applied to experimental data from small cells or subcellular compartments, the model equations have been extremely useful for obtaining quantitative information about essential parameters of Ca(2+) influx, buffering, and clearance. We illustrate also several changes that occur when the basic assumptions do not hold (e.g., when calcium diffusion, dye saturation, or kinetic effects become significant). Finally, we discuss how the changes in calcium dynamics, which are explained by the model, have been exploited for measuring properties of calcium-driven reactions, such as those regulating short-term synaptic enhancement, vesicle recycling, and adaptation.},

Novel in vivo imaging and electrophysiology methods allow longitudinal recording of the same neurons' functional properties and therefore have the critical ability to resolve the direction and dynamics of change as plasticity progresses.

The detailed construction plan of the AOD-based microscope is accompanied by equally detailed optimization procedures. We also introduce a novel random-access pattern scanning (RAPS) technique for high-speed in vivo measurements of neuronal population activity. AOD-based RAPS can measure calcium transients in neocortical neuronal populations, revealing spike trains with near-millisecond precision.

Light-sheet microscopy is ideal for such samples as it records high-contrast images of entire planes within large samples at once. However, in order to obtain images of different planes, it has been necessary to move the sample relative to the fixed focal plane of the detection objective lens. This mechanical movement limits speed, precision and may be harmful to the sample. We have built a light-sheet microscope that uses remote focusing with an electrically tunable lens (ETL). Without moving specimen or objective we have thereby achieved flexible volume imaging at much higher speeds than previously reported. Our high-speed microscope delivers 3D snapshots of sensitive biological samples. As an example, we imaged 17 planes within a beating zebrafish heart at 510 frames per second, equivalent to 30 volume scans per second. Movements, shape changes and signals across the entire volume can be followed which has been impossible with existing reconstruction techniques.},

Here we show task-dependent activation of distinct, largely non-overlapping long-range projection neurons in the whisker region of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in awake, behaving mice. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we monitored neuronal activity in anatomically identified S1 neurons projecting to secondary somatosensory (S2) or primary motor (M1) cortex in mice using their whiskers to perform a texture-discrimination task or a task that required them to detect the presence of an object at a certain location. Whisking-related cells were found among S2-projecting (S2P) but not M1-projecting (M1P) neurons. A higher fraction of S2P than M1P neurons showed touch-related responses during texture discrimination, whereas a higher fraction of M1P than S2P neurons showed touch-related responses during the detection task. In both tasks, S2P and M1P neurons could discriminate similarly between trials producing different behavioural decisions. However, in trials producing the same decision, S2P neurons performed better at discriminating texture, whereas M1P neurons were better at discriminating location. Sensory stimulus features alone were not sufficient to elicit these differences, suggesting that selective transmission of S1 information to S2 and M1 is driven by behaviour.},

It remains unclear how experimental parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and acquisition rate affect spike inference and whether additional information about network structure can be extracted. Here we present a simulation framework for quantitatively assessing how well spike dynamics and network topology can be inferred from noisy calcium imaging data. For simulated AP-evoked calcium transients in neocortical pyramidal cells, we analyzed the quality of spike inference as a function of SNR and data acquisition rate using a recently introduced peeling algorithm. Given experimentally attainable values of SNR and acquisition rate, neural spike trains could be reconstructed accurately and with up to millisecond precision. We then applied statistical neuronal network models to explore how remaining uncertainties in spike inference affect estimates of network connectivity and topological features of network organization. We define the experimental conditions suitable for inferring whether the network has a scale-free structure and determine how well hub neurons can be identified. Our findings provide a benchmark for future calcium imaging studies that aim to reliably infer neuronal network properties.},

HVC spike responses to auditory stimulation display remarkable preference for the bird's own song (BOS) compared to other stimuli. Using two-photon calcium imaging in anesthetized zebra finches we measure the spatio-temporal structure of baseline activity and of auditory evoked responses in identified populations of HVC cells. We find strong correlations between calcium signal fluctuations in nearby cells of a given type, both in identified neurons and in astroglia. In identified HVC neurons only, auditory stimulation decorrelates ongoing calcium signals, less for BOS than for other sound stimuli. Overall, calcium transients show strong preference for BOS in identified HVC neurons but not in astroglia, showing diversity in local functional organization among identified neuron and astroglia populations.},

Two-photon fiberscopes have been developed with the aim of enabling high-resolution imaging of neural activity in freely behaving animals. They use fiber optics to deliver laser light for two-photon excitation. Their small front piece typically contains a miniature scanning mechanism and imaging optics. Two-photon fiberscopes can be made sufficiently small and lightweight to be carried by rats and mice and to allow virtually unrestricted movement within a behavioral arena. Typically mounted to the animal's skull above a cranial window, two-photon fiberscopes permit imaging of cells down to at least 250 µm below the brain surface (e.g., in rat neocortex). In freely exploring animals, action-potential-evoked calcium transients can be imaged in individual somata of visual cortex neurons bulk-labeled with a calcium indicator. Two-photon fiberscopes thus enable high-resolution optical recording of neural activity with cellular resolution during natural behaviors.},

Often, licking for the retrieval of water reward is used as a measurable report of the animal's decision during reward-driven behaviour. However, licking behaviour can induce severe motion artifacts that interfere with two-photon imaging of cellular activity. Here, we describe a simple method for the online correction of licking-induced focus shifts for two-photon calcium imaging of neocortical neurons in the head-fixed mouse. We found that licking causes a stereotyped drop of neocortical tissue, shifting neurons up to 20 μm out of focus. Based on the measurement of licking with a piezo film sensor, we developed a feedback model, which provides a corrective signal for fast optical focus adjustments with an electrically tunable lens. Using online correction with this feedback model, we demonstrate a reduction of licking-related focus changes below 3 μm, minimizing motion artifact contamination of cellular calcium signals. Focus correction with a tunable lens is a simple and effective method to improve the ability to monitor neuronal activity during reward-based behaviour.},

Continuous technological advancement in the field has created a need for new control software that is flexible enough to support the biological researcher with innovative imaging techniques and provide the developer with a solid platform for quickly and easily implementing new extensions. Here, we introduce HelioScan, a software package written in LabVIEW, as a platform serving this dual role. HelioScan is designed as a collection of components that can be flexibly assembled into microscope control software tailored to the particular hardware and functionality requirements. Moreover, HelioScan provides a software framework, within which new functionality can be implemented in a quick and structured manner. A specific HelioScan application assembles at run-time from individual software components, based on user-definable configuration files. Due to its component-based architecture, HelioScan can exploit synergies of multiple developers working in parallel on different components in a community effort. We exemplify the capabilities and versatility of HelioScan by demonstrating several in vivo brain imaging modes, including camera-based intrinsic optical signal imaging for functional mapping of cortical areas, standard two-photon laser-scanning microscopy using galvanometric mirrors, and high-speed in vivo two-photon calcium imaging using either acousto-optic deflectors or a resonant scanner. We recommend HelioScan as a convenient software framework for the in vivo imaging community.},

  abstract        = {Neocortex, the neuronal structure at the base of the remarkable cognitive skills of mammals, is a layered sheet of neuronal tissue composed of juxtaposed and interconnected columns. A cortical column is considered the basic module of cortical processing present in all cortical areas. It is believed to contain a characteristic microcircuit composed of a few thousand neurons. The high degree of cortical segmentation into vertical columns and horizontal layers is a boon for scientific investigation because it eases the systematic dissection and functional analysis of intrinsic as well as extrinsic connections of the column. In this review we will argue that in order to understand neocortical function one needs to combine a microscopic view, elucidating the workings of the local columnar microcircuits, with a macroscopic view, which keeps track of the linkage of distant cortical modules in different behavioral contexts. We will exemplify this strategy using the model system of vibrissal touch in mice and rats. On the macroscopic level vibrissal touch is an important sense for the subterranean rodents and has been honed by evolution to serve an array of distinct behaviors. Importantly, the vibrissae are moved actively to touch - requiring intricate sensorimotor interactions. Vibrissal touch, therefore, offers ample opportunities to relate different behavioral contexts to specific interactions of distant columns. On the microscopic level, the cortical modules in primary somatosensory cortex process touch inputs at highest magnification and discreteness - each whisker is represented by its own so-called barrel column. The cellular composition, intrinsic connectivity and functional aspects of the barrel column have been studied in great detail. Building on the versatility of genetic tools available in rodents, new, highly selective and flexible cellular and molecular tools to monitor and manipulate neuronal activity have been devised. Researchers have started to combine these with advanced and highly precise behavioral methods, on par with the precision known from monkey preparations. Therefore, the vibrissal touch model system is exquisitely positioned to combine the microscopic with the macroscopic view and promises to be instrumental in our understanding of neocortical function.},

While two-photon imaging has been extensively used in a variety of brain regions in different species, in vivo application to the vertebrate spinal cord has lagged behind and only recently became feasible by adapting and refining the experimental preparations. A major experimental challenge for spinal cord imaging is adequate control of tissue movement, which meanwhile can be achieved by various means. One set of studies monitored structural dynamics of neuronal and glial cellular components in living animals using transgenic mice with specific expression of fluorescent proteins. Other studies employed in vivo calcium imaging for functional measurements of sensory-evoked responses in individual neurons of the dorsal horn circuitry, which at present is the only part of rodent spinal cord grey matter accessible for in vivo imaging. In a parallel approach, several research groups have applied two-photon imaging to sensorimotor circuits in the isolated spinal cord (in vitro) to provide complementary information and valuable new perspectives on the function of specific interneuron types in locomotor-related networks. In this review we summarize recent results from these types of high-resolution two-photon imaging studies in the spinal cord and provide experimental perspectives for improving and extending this approach in future applications.},

In rodents, the posteromedial area (PM) mediates visual information between primary visual cortex (V1) and the retrosplenial cortex, which further projects to the hippocampus. To understand the functional role of area PM requires a detailed analysis of its spatial frequency (SF) and temporal frequency (TF) tuning. Here, we applied two-photon calcium imaging to map neuronal tuning for orientation, direction, SF and TF, and speed in response to drifting gratings in V1 and PM of anesthetized mice. The distributions of orientation and direction tuning were similar in V1 and PM. Notably, in both areas we found a preference for cardinal compared to oblique orientations. The overrepresentation of cardinal tuned neurons was particularly strong in PM showing narrow tuning bandwidths for horizontal and vertical orientations. A detailed analysis of SF and TF tuning revealed a broad range of highly tuned neurons in V1. On the contrary, PM contained one subpopulation of neurons with high spatial acuity and a second subpopulation broadly tuned for low SFs. Furthermore, ∼20% of the responding neurons in V1 and only 12% in PM were tuned to the speed of drifting gratings with PM preferring slower drift rates compared to V1. Together, PM is tuned for cardinal orientations, high SFs, and low speed and is further located between V1 and the retrosplenial cortex consistent with a role in processing natural scenes during spatial navigation.},

Across the baseline period, neurons displayed heterogeneous yet stable responsiveness. During sensory deprivation, responses to trimmed whisker stimulation globally decreased, whereas responses to spared whisker stimulation increased for the least active neurons and decreased for the most active neurons. These findings suggest that recruitment of inactive, 'silent' neurons is part of a convergent redistribution of population activity underlying sensory map plasticity.

  abstract        = {Astrocytes are integral functional components of synapses, regulating transmission and plasticity. They have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, although their precise roles have not been comprehensively characterized. Astrocytes integrate activity from neighboring synapses by responding to neuronally released neurotransmitters such as glutamate and ATP. Strong activation of astrocytes mediated by these neurotransmitters can promote seizure-like activity by initiating a positive feedback loop that induces excessive neuronal discharge. Recent work has demonstrated that astrocytes express cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors, which are sensitive to endocannabinoids released by nearby pyramidal cells. In this study, we tested whether this mechanism also contributes to epileptiform activity. In a model of 4-aminopyridine induced epileptic-like activity in hippocampal slice cultures, we show that pharmacological blockade of astrocyte CB1 receptors did not modify the initiation, but significantly reduced the maintenance of epileptiform discharge. When communication in astrocytic networks was disrupted by chelating astrocytic calcium, this CB1 receptor-mediated modulation of epileptiform activity was no longer observed. Thus, endocannabinoid signaling from neurons to astrocytes represents an additional significant factor in the maintenance of epileptiform activity in the hippocampus.},

While such imbalance is known to be associated with alterations in glutamatergic and Ca(2+) signaling, the underlying mechanisms remain undefined. We identified the protein Ser/Thr phosphatase protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), an enzyme associated with glutamate receptors, as a key trigger of survival pathways that can prevent neuronal death and neurodegeneration in the adult hippocampus. We show that PP1α overexpression in hippocampal neurons limits NMDA receptor overactivation and Ca(2+) overload during an excitotoxic event, while PP1 inhibition favors Ca(2+) overload and cell death. The protective effect of PP1 is associated with a selective dephosphorylation on a residue phosphorylated by CaMKIIα on the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B, which promotes pro-survival pathways and associated transcriptional programs. These results reveal a novel contributor to the mechanisms of neuroprotection and underscore the importance of PP1-dependent dephosphorylation in these mechanisms. They provide a new target for the development of potential therapeutic treatment of neurodegeneration.},

Here we present a technique for long-term investigation of cortical map dynamics using wide-field ratiometric fluorescence imaging of the genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) Yellow Cameleon 3.60. We find that wide-field GECI signals report sensory-evoked activity in anaesthetized mouse somatosensory cortex with high sensitivity and spatiotemporal precision, and furthermore, can be measured repeatedly in separate imaging sessions over multiple weeks. This method opens new possibilities for the longitudinal study of stability and plasticity of cortical sensory representations.},

  abstract     = {How are visual scenes encoded in local neural networks of visual cortex? In rodents, visual cortex lacks a columnar organization so that processing of diverse features from a spot in visual space could be performed locally by populations of neighboring neurons. To examine how complex visual scenes are represented by local microcircuits in mouse visual cortex we measured visually evoked responses of layer 2/3 neuronal populations using 3D two-photon calcium imaging. Both natural and artificial movie scenes (10 seconds duration) evoked distributed and sparsely organized responses in local populations of 70-150 neurons within the sampled volumes. About 50% of neurons showed calcium transients during visual scene presentation, of which about half displayed reliable temporal activation patterns. The majority of the reliably responding neurons were activated primarily by one of the four visual scenes applied. Consequently, single-neurons performed poorly in decoding, which visual scene had been presented. In contrast, high levels of decoding performance (>80%) were reached when considering population responses, requiring about 80 randomly picked cells or 20 reliable responders. Furthermore, reliable responding neurons tended to have neighbors sharing the same stimulus preference. Because of this local redundancy, it was beneficial for efficient scene decoding to read out activity from spatially distributed rather than locally clustered neurons. Our results suggest a population code in layer 2/3 of visual cortex, where the visual environment is dynamically represented in the activation of distinct functional sub-networks.},

Here, we combined fMRI with fiber-optic recordings of fluorescent calcium indicator signals to investigate this relationship in rat somatosensory cortex. Electrical forepaw stimulation (1-10 Hz) evoked fast calcium signals of neuronal origin that showed frequency-dependent adaptation. Additionally, slower calcium signals occurred in astrocyte networks, as verified by astrocyte-specific staining and two-photon microscopy. Without apparent glia activation, we could predict BOLD responses well from simultaneously recorded fiber-optic signals, assuming an impulse response function and taking into account neuronal adaptation. In cases with glia activation, we uncovered additional prolonged BOLD signal components. Our findings highlight the complexity of fMRI BOLD signals, involving both neuronal and glial activity. Combined fMRI and fiber-optic recordings should help to clarify cellular mechanisms underlying BOLD signals.},

To understand the functional organization of these networks, it is desirable to achieve 3D activity measurements from large cell populations in intact tissue with high temporal resolution. Repeated acquisition of image stacks with standard laser-scanning microscopes is too slow. This protocol describes fast 3D calcium imaging in the living brain using mechanical laser scanning with standard galvanometric mirrors and a piezoelectric focusing element. The purpose of 3D laser scanning is to create a 3D line scan that samples relatively homogenously from a particular observation volume. The spatial resolution of this approach is low, except along the line. However, the main goal is not to resolve subcellular structures, but rather to hit as many cell bodies as possible within the volume. In this manner, local network activity can be inferred from the somatic calcium signals of a significant fraction of the cell population. With a sinusoidal swinging microscope objective as a constraint, 3D scan trajectories are generated that sample fluorescence signals from the majority of cells within a cuboidal volume. Measurements with 10-Hz temporal resolution can be achieved for population calcium signals from several hundreds of identified neurons and glial cells within cuboids with side lengths of ∼250 µm. An example cellular 3D orientation map of the rat visual cortex is presented. This 3D laser-scanning technique enables direct observation of in vivo neural network dynamics in cell populations of substantial size.},

Alternative viral approaches for targeted fluorophore expression are relatively invasive. For astrocytes, there is a simple alternative. This protocol describes an easy and robust method for rapid (within minutes) and high-contrast staining of astrocytes in defined regions of the intact rodent cortex using the synthetic, water-soluble but non-fixable red fluorescent dye sulforhodamine 101 (SR101). Selective staining is achieved through local uptake and gap junction-mediated spread of SR101 following its topical application or injection into tissue. Applications, technical pitfalls, and limitations of the SR101-staining technique are discussed. Given its simplicity and reliability, SR101 staining is a valuable tool for the study of astrocyte function in the intact brain and for in vivo fluorescence microscopy in general.},

Little information is available, however, about functional properties of distinct subtypes of GABAergic neurons in the intact brain. Here, we combined in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in supragranular layers of the mouse neocortex with post hoc immunohistochemistry against the three calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin, calretinin, and calbindin in order to assign subtype marker profiles to neuronal activity. Following coronal sectioning of fixed brains, we matched cells in corresponding volumes of image stacks acquired in vivo and in fixed brain slices. In GAD67-GFP mice, more than 95% of the GABAergic cells could be unambiguously matched, even in large volumes comprising more than a thousand interneurons. Triple immunostaining revealed a depth-dependent distribution of interneuron subtypes with increasing abundance of PV-positive neurons with depth. Most importantly, the triple-labeling approach was compatible with previous in vivo calcium imaging following bulk loading of Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1, which allowed us to classify spontaneous calcium transients recorded in vivo according to the neurochemically defined GABAergic subtypes. Moreover, we demonstrate that post hoc immunostaining can also be applied to wild-type mice expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator Yellow Cameleon 3.60 in cortical neurons. Our approach is a general and flexible method to distinguish GABAergic subtypes in cell populations previously imaged in the living animal. It should thus facilitate dissecting the functional roles of these subtypes in neural circuitry.},

By combining the axial scanning method with 2D acousto-optic frame scanning and random-access scanning, we measured neuronal population activity of about 40 neurons across two imaging planes separated by 40 μm and achieved scan rates up to 20-30 Hz.

Using a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography system, which produces real-time cross-sectional images of the axon in a nerve chamber, axonal surfaces along a depth profile are monitored. Differential phase analyses show transient changes around the membrane on a millisecond timescale, and the response is coincident with the arrival of the action potential at the optical measurement area. Cooling the axon slows the electrical and optical responses and increases the magnitude of the transient signals. Increasing the NaCl concentration bathing the axon, whose diameter is decreased in the hypertonic solution, results in significantly larger transient signals during action potential propagation. While monophasic and biphasic behaviors are observed, biphasic behavior dominates the results. The initial phase detected was constant for a single location but alternated for different locations; therefore, these transient signals acquired around the membrane appear to have local characteristics.},

  abstract        = {1. The light-induced electrical responses of barnacle photoreceptors spread decrementally along the cells' axons. The decay of the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing components of the visual signal was studied by recording intracellularly from single receptor axons of the median ocellus of the giant barnacle.2. The resistance of the photoreceptor neurone decreases markedly when the cell is depolarized with respect to its dark resting potential of -60 mV. This rectification results in differential attenuation of the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing components of the visual signal as they spread down the axon. Consequently, the visual signal entering the synaptic region is conspicuously distorted.3. Bathing the photoreceptor axons in sodium-free or calcium-free saline or in isotonic sucrose does not significantly affect the spread of the visual signal to the terminals. Thus the signal is not amplified by an ionic mechanism along the axon.4. Membrane characteristics of the photoreceptor for hyperpolarizing voltage changes were estimated from (a) the ratio of the amplitudes of the visual signals recorded simultaneously in the axon and in the soma, (b) the time constant, and (c) the input resistance of the cell. All three independent measurements are consistent with a length constant 1 to 2 times the total length of the cell (lambda = 10-18 mm) and an unusually high membrane resistivity of about 300 kOmega cm(2). This resistivity enables the receptor potential to spread passively to the terminal region.5. Electron microscopic examination of receptor axons reveals an investment of glial lamellae, but demonstrates neither unusual structures which would lead to a high apparent membrane resistivity, nor junctions between cells which would seal off the extracellular space. Thus the observed high resistivity appears to be an intrinsic property of the receptor membrane.},

To investigate frontothalamic substrates of cognitive flexibility, we developed a behavioral task in which mice switched between different sets of learned cues that guided attention toward either visual or auditory targets. We found that PFC responses reflected both the individual cues and their meaning as task rules, indicating a hierarchical cue-to-rule transformation. Conversely, mediodorsal thalamus responses reflected the statistical regularity of cue presentation and were required for switching between such experimentally specified cueing contexts. A subset of these thalamic responses sustained context-relevant PFC representations, while another suppressed the context-irrelevant ones. Through modeling and experimental validation, we find that thalamic-mediated suppression may not only reduce PFC representational interference but could also preserve unused cortical traces for future use. Overall, our study provides a computational foundation for thalamic engagement in cognitive flexibility.},

  abstract     = {In many studies of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), stimulus encoding and processing (perceptual function) and response selection (executive function) have been intertwined. To dissociate deficits in these functions, we introduced a task that parametrically varied low-level stimulus features (orientation and color) for fine-grained analysis of perceptual function. It also required participants to switch their attention between feature dimensions on a trial-by-trial basis, thus taxing executive processes. Furthermore, we used a response paradigm that captured task-irrelevant motor output (TIMO), reflecting failures to use the correct stimulus-response rule. ADHD participants had substantially higher perceptual variability than controls, especially for orientation, as well as higher TIMO. In both ADHD and controls, TIMO was strongly affected by the switch manipulation. Across participants, the perceptual variability parameter was correlated with TIMO, suggesting that perceptual deficits are associated with executive function deficits. Based on perceptual variability alone, we were able to classify participants into ADHD and controls with a mean accuracy of about 77%. Participants' self-reported General Executive Composite score correlated not only with TIMO but also with the perceptual variability parameter. Our results highlight the role of perceptual deficits in ADHD and the usefulness of computational modeling of behavior in dissociating perceptual from executive processes.},

Here, we review anatomical, physiological, and behavioral studies along evolutionary and theoretical dimensions, arguing for essential and unique thalamic computations in cognition. Considering their architectural features as well as their ability to initiate, sustain, and switch cortical activity, thalamic circuits appear uniquely suited for computing contextual signals that rapidly reconfigure task-relevant cortical representations. We introduce a framework that formalizes this notion, show its consistency with several findings, and discuss its prediction of thalamic roles in perceptual inference and behavioral flexibility. Overall, our framework emphasizes an expanded view of the thalamus in cognitive computations and provides a roadmap to test several of its theoretical and experimental predictions.},

Although psychiatric genetics provide insight into the genetic underpinning of such disorders, with a majority of cases explained by polygenic factors, it remains difficult to design rational treatments. In this review, we highlight the value of understanding neural circuit function both as an intermediate level of explanatory description that links gene to behavior and as a pathway for developing rational diagnostics and therapeutics for behavioral disorders. As neural circuits perform hierarchically organized computational functions and give rise to network-level processes (e.g., macroscopic rhythms and goal-directed or homeostatic behaviors), correlated network-level deficits may indicate perturbation of a specific circuit. Therefore, identifying such correlated deficits or a circuit endophenotype would provide a mechanistic point of entry, enhancing both diagnosis and treatment of a given behavioral disorder. We focus on a circuit endophenotype of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and how its impairment in neurodevelopmental disorders gives rise to a correlated set of readouts across sleep and attention. Because TRN neurons express several disorder-relevant genes identified through genome-wide association studies, exploring the consequences of different TRN disruptions may be of broad translational significance.},

A subset of these functions is required for goal-directed selection and amplification of sensory signals-broadly referred to as attention-and for its flexible control and its interaction with processes such as working memory and decision making. While the contribution of recurrent cortical microcircuits to cognition has been extensively studied, the role of the thalamus is just beginning to be elucidated. Here we highlight recent studies across rodents and primates showing how thalamus contributes to attentional control. In addition to high-fidelity information relay to or between cortical regions, thalamic circuits shift and sustain functional interactions within and across cortical areas. This thalamic process enables rapid coordination of spatially segregated cortical computations, thereby constructing task-relevant functional networks. Because such function may be critical for cognitive flexibility, clarifying its mechanisms will likely expand our basic understanding of cognitive control and its perturbation in disease.},

Additionally, thalamic control of cortical connectivity bridges general arousal to the specific processing of categorical content, providing an intermediate level of cognitive and circuit description that will facilitate mapping neural computations onto thought and behavior.},

Recent studies have shown diverse connectivity patterns across the thalamus, but whether this diversity translates to thalamic functions beyond relaying information to or between cortical regions is unknown. Here we show, by investigating the representation of two rules used to guide attention in the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC), that the mediodorsal thalamus sustains these representations without relaying categorical information. Specifically, mediodorsal input amplifies local PFC connectivity, enabling rule-specific neural sequences to emerge and thereby maintain rule representations. Consistent with this notion, broadly enhancing PFC excitability diminishes rule specificity and behavioural performance, whereas enhancing mediodorsal excitability improves both. Overall, our results define a previously unknown principle in neuroscience; thalamic control of functional cortical connectivity. This function, which is dissociable from categorical information relay, indicates that the thalamus has a much broader role in cognition than previously thought.},

  abstract        = {Independently adjustable multielectrode arrays are routinely used to interrogate neuronal circuit function, enabling chronic   monitoring of neuronal ensembles in freely behaving animals at a single-cell, single spike resolution. Despite the importance of this approach, its widespread use is limited by highly specialized design and fabrication methods. To address this, we have developed a Scalable, Lightweight, Integrated and Quick-to-assemble multielectrode array platform. This platform additionally integrates optical fibers with independently adjustable electrodes to allow simultaneous single unit recordings and circuit-specific optogenetic targeting and/or manipulation. In current designs, the fully assembled platforms are scalable from 2 to 32 microdrives, and yet range 1-3 g, light enough for small animals. Here, we describe the design process starting from intent in computer-aided design, parameter testing through finite element analysis and experimental means, and implementation of various applications across mice and rats. Combined, our methods may expand the utility of multielectrode recordings and their continued integration with other tools enabling functional dissection of intact neural circuits.},

During REM sleep, the brain exhibits prominent activity in the 5-8 Hz (theta) frequency range. How REM sleep onset and theta waves are regulated is poorly understood. Astrocytes, a non-neuronal cell type in the brain, respond to cholinergic signals by elevating their intracellular Ca  concentration. The goal of this study was to assess the sleep architecture of mice with attenuated IP  mediated Ca  signaling in astrocytes. Vigilance states and cortical electroencephalograph power were measured in wild type mice and mice with attenuated IP /Ca  signaling. Attenuating IP /Ca  signaling specifically in astrocytes caused mice to spend more time in REM sleep and enter this state more frequently during their inactive phase. These mice also exhibited greater power in the theta frequency range. These data suggest a role for astrocytic IP /Ca  signaling in modulating REM sleep and the associated physiological state of the cortex.},

Thalamic circuits are targeted by two major inhibitory systems: the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and extrathalamic inhibitory (ETI) inputs. A unifying framework of how these systems operate is currently lacking. Here, we propose that TRN circuits are specialized to exert thalamic control at different spatiotemporal scales. Local inhibition of thalamic spike rates prevails during attentional selection, whereas global inhibition more likely prevails during sleep. In contrast, the ETI (arising from basal ganglia, zona incerta (ZI), anterior pretectum, and pontine reticular formation) provides temporally precise and focal inhibition, impacting spike timing. Together, these inhibitory systems allow graded control of thalamic output, enabling thalamocortical operations to dynamically match ongoing behavioral demands.},

  abstract        = {The hippocampus is critical for the storage of new autobiographical experiences as memories. Following an initial encoding stage in the hippocampus, memories undergo a process of systems-level consolidation, which leads to greater stability through time and an increased reliance on neocortical areas for retrieval. The extent to which the retrieval of these consolidated memories still requires the hippocampus is unclear, as both spared and severely degraded remote memory recall have been reported following post-training hippocampal lesions. One difficulty in definitively addressing the role of the hippocampus in remote memory retrieval is the precision with which the entire volume of the hippocampal region can be inactivated. To address this issue, we used Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), a chemical-genetic tool capable of highly specific neuronal manipulation over large volumes of brain tissue. We find that remote (>7 weeks after acquisition), but not recent (1-2 days after acquisition) contextual fear memories can be recalled after injection of the DREADD agonist (CNO) in animals expressing the inhibitory DREADD in the entire hippocampus. Our data demonstrate a time-dependent role of the hippocampus in memory retrieval, supporting the standard model of systems consolidation.},

  abstract        = {Developmental disabilities, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), intellectual disability (ID), and autism spectrum disorders (ASD), affect one in six children in the USA. Recently, gene mutations in patched domain containing 1 (PTCHD1) have been found in ~1% of patients with ID and ASD. Individuals with PTCHD1 deletion show symptoms of ADHD, sleep disruption, hypotonia, aggression, ASD, and ID. Although PTCHD1 is probably critical for normal development, the connection between its deletion and the ensuing behavioural defects is poorly understood. Here we report that during early post-natal development, mouse Ptchd1 is selectively expressed in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic neurons that regulate thalamocortical transmission, sleep rhythms, and attention. Ptchd1 deletion attenuates TRN activity through mechanisms involving small conductance calcium-dependent potassium currents (SK). TRN-restricted deletion of Ptchd1 leads to attention deficits and hyperactivity, both of which are rescued by pharmacological augmentation of SK channel activity. Global Ptchd1 deletion recapitulates learning impairment, hyper-aggression, and motor defects, all of which are insensitive to SK pharmacological targeting and not found in the TRN-restricted deletion mouse. This study maps clinically relevant behavioural phenotypes onto TRN dysfunction in a human disease model, while also identifying molecular and circuit targets for intervention.},

Here, we provide an alternative explanation for this correlation: common thalamic circuits regulate sensory processing across sleep and attention, and their disruption may lead to correlated dysfunction. Using multi-electrode recordings in mice, we find that rate and rhythmicity of thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) neurons are predictive of their functional organization in sleep and suggestive of their participation in sensory processing across states. Surprisingly, TRN neurons associated with spindles in sleep are also associated with alpha oscillations during attention. As such, we propose that common thalamic circuit principles regulate sensory processing in a state-invariant manner and that in certain disorders, targeting these circuits may be a more viable therapeutic strategy than considering individual states in isolation.},

  abstract        = {How the brain selects appropriate sensory inputs and suppresses distractors is unknown. Given the well-established role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in executive function, its interactions with sensory cortical areas during attention have been hypothesized to control sensory selection. To test this idea and, more generally, dissect the circuits underlying sensory selection, we developed a cross-modal divided-attention task in mice that allowed genetic access to this cognitive process. By optogenetically perturbing PFC function in a temporally precise window, the ability of mice to select appropriately between conflicting visual and auditory stimuli was diminished. Equivalent sensory thalamocortical manipulations showed that behaviour was causally dependent on PFC interactions with the sensory thalamus, not sensory cortex. Consistent with this notion, we found neurons of the visual thalamic reticular nucleus (visTRN) to exhibit PFC-dependent changes in firing rate predictive of the modality selected. visTRN activity was causal to performance as confirmed by bidirectional optogenetic manipulations of this subnetwork. Using a combination of electrophysiology and intracellular chloride photometry, we demonstrated that visTRN dynamically controls visual thalamic gain through feedforward inhibition. Our experiments introduce a new subcortical model of sensory selection, in which the PFC biases thalamic reticular subnetworks to control thalamic sensory gain, selecting appropriate inputs for further processing.},

Slow waves are locally regulated, and local slow wave dynamics are important for memory, cognition, and behaviour. While several brainstem structures for controlling global sleep states have now been well characterized, a mechanism underlying fast and local modulation of cortical slow waves has not been identified. Here, using optogenetics and whole cortex electrophysiology, we show that local tonic activation of thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) rapidly induces slow wave activity in a spatially restricted region of cortex. These slow waves resemble those seen in sleep, as cortical units undergo periods of silence phase-locked to the slow wave. Furthermore, animals exhibit behavioural changes consistent with a decrease in arousal state during TRN stimulation. We conclude that TRN can induce rapid modulation of local cortical state.},

  abstract        = {Behavioral state is known to influence interactions between thalamus and cortex, which are important for sensation, action, and cognition. The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is hypothesized to regulate thalamo-cortical interactions, but the underlying functional architecture of this process and its state dependence are unknown. By combining the first TRN ensemble recording with psychophysics and connectivity-based optogenetic tagging, we found reticular circuits to be composed of distinct subnetworks. While activity of limbic-projecting TRN neurons positively correlates with arousal, sensory-projecting neurons participate in spindles and show elevated synchrony by slow waves during sleep. Sensory-projecting neurons are suppressed by attentional states, demonstrating that their gating of thalamo-cortical interactions is matched to behavioral state. Bidirectional manipulation of attentional performance was achieved through subnetwork-specific optogenetic stimulation. Together, our findings provide evidence for differential inhibition of thalamic nuclei across brain states, where the TRN separately controls external sensory and internal limbic processing facilitating normal cognitive function.

  abstract        = {The number of physiological investigations in the mouse, mus musculus, has experienced a recent surge, paralleling the growth in methods of genetic targeting for microcircuit dissection and disease modeling. The introduction of optogenetics, for example, has allowed for bidirectional manipulation of genetically-identified neurons, at an unprecedented temporal resolution. To capitalize on these tools and gain insight into dynamic interactions among brain microcircuits, it is essential that one has the ability to record from ensembles of neurons deep within the brain of this small rodent, in both head-fixed and freely behaving preparations. To record from deep structures and distinct cell layers requires a preparation that allows precise advancement of electrodes towards desired brain regions. To record neural ensembles, it is necessary that each electrode be independently movable, allowing the experimenter to resolve individual cells while leaving neighboring electrodes undisturbed. To do both in a freely behaving mouse requires an electrode drive that is lightweight, resilient, and highly customizable for targeting specific brain structures. A technique for designing and fabricating miniature, ultralight weight, microdrive electrode arrays that are individually customizable and easily assembled from commercially available parts is presented. These devices are easily scalable and can be customized to the structure being targeted; it has been used successfully to record from thalamic and cortical regions in a freely behaving animal during natural behavior.},

  abstract        = {Sleep impairments are comorbid with a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders including depression, epilepsy, and alcohol abuse. Despite the prevalence of these disorders, the cellular mechanisms underlying the interaction between sleep disruption and behavior remain poorly understood. In this study, the impact of chronic sleep loss on sleep homeostasis was examined in C57BL/6J mice following 3 d of sleep restriction. The electroencephalographic power of slow-wave activity (SWA; 0.5-4 Hz) in nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and adenosine tone were measured during and after sleep restriction, and following subsequent acute sleep deprivation. During the first day of sleep restriction, SWA and adenosine tone increased, indicating a homeostatic response to sleep loss. On subsequent days, SWA declined, and this was accompanied by a corresponding reduction in adenosine tone caused by a loss of one source of extracellular adenosine. Furthermore, the response to acute sleep deprivation (6 h) was significantly attenuated in sleep-restricted mice. These effects were long-lasting with reduced SWA and adenosine tone persisting for at least 2 weeks. To investigate the behavioral consequences of chronic sleep restriction, sensitivity to the motor-impairing effects of alcohol was also examined. Sleep-restricted mice were significantly less sensitive to alcohol when tested 24 h after sleep restriction, an effect that persisted for 4 weeks. Intracerebroventricular infusion of an adenosine A1 receptor antagonist produced a similar decrease in sensitivity to alcohol. These results suggest that chronic sleep restriction induces a sustained impairment in adenosine-regulated sleep homeostasis and consequentially impacts the response to alcohol.},

  abstract        = {Sleep deprivation (SD) can have a negative impact on cognitive function, but the mechanism(s) by which SD modulates memory remains unclear. We have previously shown that astrocyte-derived adenosine is a candidate molecule involved in the cognitive deficits following a brief period of SD (Halassa et al., 2009). In this study, we examined whether genetic disruption of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attached protein (SNARE)-dependent exocytosis in astrocytes (dnSNARE mice) or pharmacological blockade of A1 receptor signaling using an adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) antagonist, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine (CPT), could prevent the negative effects of 6 h of SD on hippocampal late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) and hippocampus-dependent spatial object recognition memory. We found that SD impaired L-LTP in wild-type mice but not in dnSNARE mice. Similarly, this deficit in L-LTP resulting from SD was prevented by a chronic infusion of CPT. Consistent with these results, we found that hippocampus-dependent memory deficits produced by SD were rescued in dnSNARE mice and CPT-treated mice. These data provide the first evidence that astrocytic ATP and adenosine A1R activity contribute to the effects of SD on hippocampal synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent memory, and suggest a new therapeutic target to reverse the hippocampus-related cognitive deficits induced by sleep loss.},

In sleep, thalamocortical dynamics are thought to mediate "offline" functions including memory consolidation and synaptic scaling. Here, I discuss thalamocortical sleep dynamics and their modulation by the ascending arousal system and locally released neurochemicals. I focus on modulation of these dynamics by electrically silent astrocytes, highlighting the role of purinergic signaling in this glial form of communication. Astrocytes modulate cortical slow oscillations, sleep behavior, and sleep-dependent cognitive function. The discovery that astrocytes can modulate sleep dynamics and sleep-related behaviors suggests a new way of thinking about the brain, in which integrated circuits of neurons and glia control information processing and behavioral output.},

Astrocytes respond to neuronal activity and neurotransmitters, through the activation of metabotropic receptors, and can release the gliotransmitters ATP, d-serine, and glutamate, which act on neurons. Astrocyte-derived ATP modulates synaptic transmission, either directly or through its metabolic product adenosine. d-serine modulates NMDA receptor function, whereas glia-derived glutamate can play important roles in relapse following withdrawal from drugs of abuse.

Inhibition of gliotransmission by the expression of a dominant negative SNARE domain in astrocytes affected cortical slow oscillations, reducing the duration of neuronal depolarizations and causing prolonged hyperpolarizations. These network effects result from the astrocytic modulation of intracortical synaptic transmission at two sites: a hypofunction of postsynaptic NMDA receptors, and by reducing extracellular adenosine, a loss of tonic A1 receptor-mediated inhibition. These results demonstrate that rhythmic brain activity is generated by the coordinated action of the neuronal and glial networks.},

  abstract        = {Astrocytes are known to release several transmitters to impact neuronal activity. Cell-specific molecular genetic attenuation of vesicular release has shown that ATP is a primary astrocytic transmitter in situ and in vivo. In this review, we discuss the biology of astrocytic ATP release highlighting the exciting discovery that lysosomes might be primary stores for the release of this gliotransmitter. In addition, we discuss the role of ATP and its metabolite adenosine on synaptic transmission and the coordination of synaptic networks. Finally, we discuss the recent elucidation of the involvement of this form of glial signaling in the modulation of mammalian behavior. By controlling neuronal A1-receptor signaling, astrocytes modulate mammalian sleep homeostasis and are essential for mediating the cognitive consequences of sleep deprivation. These discoveries begin to paint a new picture of brain function in which slow-signaling glia modulate fast synaptic transmission and neuronal firing to impact behavioral output. Because these cells have privileged access to synapses, they may be valuable targets for the development of novel therapies for many neurological and psychiatric conditions.},

Since one outcome of SNARE-dependent gliotransmission is the regulation of extracellular adenosine and because adenosine promotes sleep, we genetically inhibited the release of gliotransmitters and asked if astrocytes play an unsuspected role in sleep regulation. Inhibiting gliotransmission attenuated the accumulation of sleep pressure, assessed by measuring the slow wave activity of the EEG during NREM sleep, and prevented cognitive deficits associated with sleep loss. Since the sleep-suppressing effects of the A1 receptor antagonist CPT were prevented following inhibition of gliotransmission and because intracerebroventricular delivery of CPT to wild-type mice mimicked the transgenic phenotype, we conclude that astrocytes modulate the accumulation of sleep pressure and its cognitive consequences through a pathway involving A1 receptors.},

  abstract        = {In the mammalian brain, astrocytes modulate neuronal function, in part, by synchronizing neuronal firing and coordinating synaptic networks. Little, however, is known about how this is accomplished from a structural standpoint. To investigate the structural basis of astrocyte-mediated neuronal synchrony and synaptic coordination, the three-dimensional relationships between cortical astrocytes and neurons was investigated. Using a transgenic and viral approach to label astrocytes with enhanced green fluorescent protein, we performed a three-dimensional reconstruction of astrocytes from tissue sections or live animals in vivo. We found that cortical astrocytes occupy nonoverlapping territories similar to those described in the hippocampus. Using immunofluorescence labeling of neuronal somata, a single astrocyte enwraps on average four neuronal somata with an upper limit of eight. Single-neuron dye-fills allowed us to estimate that one astrocyte contacts 300-600 neuronal dendrites. Together with the recent findings showing that glial Ca2+ signaling is restricted to individual astrocytes in vivo, and that Ca2+ signaling leads to gliotransmission, we propose the concept of functional islands of synapses in which groups of synapses confined within the boundaries of an individual astrocyte are modulated by the gliotransmitter environment controlled by that astrocyte. Our description offers a new structurally based conceptual framework to evaluate functional data involving interactions between neurons and astrocytes in the mammalian brain.},

Recent experimental results have raised the possibility that quantitative variations in gliotransmission might contribute to disorders of the nervous system. Here, we discuss targeted molecular genetic approaches that have demonstrated that alterations in protein expression in astrocytes can lead to serious changes in neuronal function. We also introduce the concept of 'astrocyte activation spectrum' in which enhanced and reduced gliotransmission might contribute to epilepsy and schizophrenia, respectively. The results of future experimental tests of the astrocyte activation spectrum, which relates gliotransmission to neurological and psychiatric disorders, might point to a new therapeutic target in the brain.},

Using immunocytochemistry and single-cell multiplex reverse transcription-PCR we demonstrate the presence of these proteins and their transcripts within astrocytes freshly isolated from the hippocampus. Moreover, immunoelectron microscopy demonstrates the presence of VGLUT1 in processes of astrocytes of the hippocampus. To determine whether calcium-dependent glutamate release is mediated by exocytosis, we expressed the SNARE motif of synaptobrevin II to prevent the formation of SNARE complexes, which reduces glutamate release from astrocytes. To further determine whether vesicular exocytosis mediates calcium-dependent glutamate release from astrocytes, we performed whole cell capacitance measurements from individual astrocytes and demonstrate an increase in whole cell capacitance, coincident with glutamate release. Together, these data allow us to conclude that astrocytes in situ express vesicle proteins necessary for filling vesicles with the chemical transmitter glutamate and that astrocytes release glutamate through a vesicle- or fusion-related mechanism.},

  abstract        = {Loss of sleep causes an increase in sleep drive and deficits in hippocampal-dependent memory. Both of these responses are thought to require activation of adenosine A1 receptors (adorA1Rs) and release of transmitter molecules including ATP, which is rapidly converted to adenosine in the extracellular space, from astrocytes in a process termed gliotransmission. Although it is increasingly clear that astrocyte-derived adenosine plays an important role in driving the homeostatic sleep response and the effects of sleep loss on memory (Halassa et al., 2009; Florian et al., 2011), previous studies have not determined whether the concentration of this signaling molecule increases in response to wakefulness. Here, we show that the level of adorA1R activation increases in response to wakefulness in mice (Mus musculus). We found that this increase affected synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and modulated network activity in the cortex. Direct biosensor-based measurement of adenosine showed that the net extracellular concentration of this transmitter increased in response to normal wakefulness and sleep deprivation. Genetic inhibition of gliotransmission prevented this increase and attenuated the wakefulness-dependent changes in synaptic and network regulation by adorA1R. Consequently, we conclude that wakefulness increases the level of extracellular adenosine in the hippocampus and that this increase requires the release of transmitters from astroctyes.},

  abstract        = {Chemical transmitters released from astrocytes, termed gliotransmitters, modulate synaptic transmission and neuronal function. Using astrocyte-specific inducible transgenicmice (dnSNARE mice), we have demonstrated that inhibiting gliotransmission leads to reduced activation of adenosine A1 receptors (A1R) and impaired sleep homeostasis (Halassa et al. (2009) Neuron 61:213-219); Pascual et al. (2005) Science 310:113-116). Additionally, synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) currents are reduced in these astrocyte-specific transgenic animals (Fellin et al. (2009) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 106:15037-15042). Because of the importance of adenosine and NMDA receptors to sleep processes we asked whether there is a causal linkage between changes in A1R activation and synaptic NMDA receptors. We show that astrocytic dnSNARE expression leads to reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of Srckinase and NR2 subunits concomitant with the decreased surface expression of the NR2 subunits. To test the role of A1R signaling in mediating these actions, we show that incubation of wildtype (WT) slices with an A1R antagonist reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of Src kinase and NR2B, decreases the surface expression of the NR2B subunits and leads to smaller NMDA component of miniature EPSCs. In dnSNARE mice we could rescue WT phenotype by incubation in an A1R agonist:activation of A1 receptor led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Src kinase and NR2B subunits as well as increased the surface expression of the NR2B subunit and increased NMDA component of the synaptic mEPSC. These results provide the first demonstration that astrocytes can affect neuronal excitability on a long time scale by regulating the surface expression of NMDA receptors through the activation of specific intracellular signaling pathways.},

  abstract        = {The ability to generate variable movements is essential for learning and adjusting complex behaviours. This variability has been linked to the temporal irregularity of neuronal activity in the central nervous system. However, how neuronal irregularity actually translates into behavioural variability is unclear. Here we combine modelling, electrophysiological and behavioural studies to address this issue. We demonstrate that a model circuit comprising topographically organized and strongly recurrent neural networks can autonomously generate irregular motor behaviours. Simultaneous recordings of neurons in singing finches reveal that neural correlations increase across the circuit driving song variability, in agreement with the model predictions. Analysing behavioural data, we find remarkable similarities in the babbling statistics of 5-6-month-old human infants and juveniles from three songbird species and show that our model naturally accounts for these 'universal' statistics.},

  abstract        = {Absence seizures are characterized by brief interruptions of conscious experience accompanied by oscillations of activity synchronized across many brain areas. Although the dynamics of the thalamocortical circuits are traditionally thought to underlie absence seizures, converging experimental evidence supports the key involvement of the basal ganglia (BG). In this theoretical work, we argue that the BG are essential for the maintenance of absence seizures. To this end, we combine analytical calculations with numerical simulations to investigate a computational model of the BG-thalamo-cortical network. We demonstrate that abnormally strong striatal feedforward inhibition can promote synchronous oscillatory activity that persists in the network over several tens of seconds as observed during seizures. We show that these maintained oscillations result from an interplay between the negative feedback through the cortico-subthalamo-nigral pathway and the striatal feedforward inhibition. The negative feedback promotes epileptic oscillations whereas the striatal feedforward inhibition suppresses the positive feedback provided by the cortico-striato-nigral pathway. Our theory is consistent with experimental evidence regarding the influence of BG on seizures (e.g., with the fact that a pharmacological blockade of the subthalamo-nigral pathway suppresses seizures). It also accounts for the observed strong suppression of the striatal output during seizures. Our theory predicts that well-timed transient excitatory inputs to the cortex advance the termination of absence seizures. In contrast with the thalamocortical theory, it also predicts that reducing the synaptic transmission along the cortico-subthalamo-nigral pathway while keeping constant the average firing rate of substantia nigra pars reticulata reduces the incidence of seizures. Absence seizures are characterized by brief interruptions of consciousness accompanied by abnormal brain oscillations persisting tens of seconds. Thalamocortical circuits are traditionally thought to underlie absence seizures. However, recent experiments have highlighted the key role of the basal ganglia (BG). This work argues for a novel theory according to which the BG drive the oscillatory patterns of activity occurring during the seizures. It demonstrates that abnormally strong striatal feedforward inhibition promotes synchronous oscillatory activity in the BG-thalamo-cortical network and relate this property to the observed strong suppression of the striatal output during seizures. The theory is compatible with virtually all known experimental results, and it predicts that well-timed transient excitatory inputs to the cortex advance the termination of absence seizures.},

  abstract     = {Neuronal activity in the central nervous system varies strongly in time and across neuronal populations. It is a longstanding proposal that such fluctuations generically arise from chaotic network dynamics. Various theoretical studies predict that the rich dynamics of rate models operating in the chaotic regime can subserve circuit computation and learning. Neurons in the brain, however, communicate via spikes and it is a theoretical challenge to obtain similar rate fluctuations in networks of spiking neuron models. A recent study investigated spiking balanced networks of leaky integrate and fire (LIF) neurons and compared their dynamics to a matched rate network with identical topology, where single unit input-output functions were chosen from isolated LIF neurons receiving Gaussian white noise input. A mathematical analogy between the chaotic instability in networks of rate units and the spiking network dynamics was proposed. Here we revisit the behavior of the spiking LIF networks and these matched rate networks. We find expected hallmarks of a chaotic instability in the rate network: For supercritical coupling strength near the transition point, the autocorrelation time diverges. For subcritical coupling strengths, we observe critical slowing down in response to small external perturbations. In the spiking network, we found in contrast that the timescale of the autocorrelations is insensitive to the coupling strength and that rate deviations resulting from small input perturbations rapidly decay. The decay speed even accelerates for increasing coupling strength. In conclusion, our reanalysis demonstrates fundamental differences between the behavior of pulse-coupled spiking LIF networks and rate networks with matched topology and input-output function. In particular there is no indication of a corresponding chaotic instability in the spiking network.},

  abstract        = {The dependence of the synaptic responses on the history of activation and their large variability are both distinctive features of repetitive transmission at chemical synapses. Quantitative investigations have mostly focused on trial-averaged responses to characterize dynamic aspects of the transmission--thus disregarding variability--or on the fluctuations of the responses in steady conditions to characterize variability--thus disregarding dynamics. We present a statistically principled framework to quantify the dynamics of the probability distribution of synaptic responses under arbitrary patterns of activation. This is achieved by constructing a generative model of repetitive transmission, which includes an explicit description of the sources of stochasticity present in the process. The underlying parameters are then selected via an expectation-maximization algorithm that is exact for a large class of models of synaptic transmission, so as to maximize the likelihood of the observed responses. The method exploits the information contained in the correlation between responses to produce highly accurate estimates of both quantal and dynamic parameters from the same recordings. The method also provides important conceptual and technical advances over existing state-of-the-art techniques. In particular, the repetition of the same stimulation in identical conditions becomes unnecessary. This paves the way to the design of optimal protocols to estimate synaptic parameters, to the quantitative comparison of synaptic models over benchmark datasets, and, most importantly, to the study of repetitive transmission under physiologically relevant patterns of synaptic activation.},

  abstract        = {When a perturbation is applied in a sensorimotor transformation task, subjects can adapt and maintain performance by either relying on sensory feedback, or, in the absence of such feedback, on information provided by rewards. For example, in a classical rotation task where movement endpoints must be rotated to reach a fixed target, human subjects can successfully adapt their reaching movements solely on the basis of binary rewards, although this proves much more difficult than with visual feedback. Here, we investigate such a reward-driven sensorimotor adaptation process in a minimal computational model of the task. The key assumption of the model is that synaptic plasticity is gated by the reward. We study how the learning dynamics depend on the target size, the movement variability, the rotation angle and the number of targets. We show that when the movement is perturbed for multiple targets, the adaptation process for the different targets can interfere destructively or constructively depending on the similarities between the sensory stimuli (the targets) and the overlap in their neuronal representations. Destructive interferences can result in a drastic slowdown of the adaptation. As a result of interference, the time to adapt varies non-linearly with the number of targets. Our analysis shows that these interferences are weaker if the reward varies smoothly with the subject's performance instead of being binary. We demonstrate how shaping the reward or shaping the task can accelerate the adaptation dramatically by reducing the destructive interferences. We argue that experimentally investigating the dynamics of reward-driven sensorimotor adaptation for more than one sensory stimulus can shed light on the underlying learning rules.},

Theoretical studies over the last twenty years have described various computational advantages for such regimes in neuronal systems. Nevertheless, it still remains unclear whether chaos requires specific cellular properties or network architectures, or whether it is a generic property of neuronal circuits. We investigate the dynamics of networks of excitatory-inhibitory (EI) spiking neurons with random sparse connectivity operating in the regime of balance of excitation and inhibition. Combining Dynamical Mean-Field Theory with numerical simulations, we show that chaotic, asynchronous firing rate fluctuations emerge generically for sufficiently strong synapses. Two different mechanisms can lead to these chaotic fluctuations. One mechanism relies on slow I-I inhibition which gives rise to slow subthreshold voltage and rate fluctuations. The decorrelation time of these fluctuations is proportional to the time constant of the inhibition. The second mechanism relies on the recurrent E-I-E feedback loop. It requires slow excitation but the inhibition can be fast. In the corresponding dynamical regime all neurons exhibit rate fluctuations on the time scale of the excitation. Another feature of this regime is that the population-averaged firing rate is substantially smaller in the excitatory population than in the inhibitory population. This is not necessarily the case in the I-I mechanism. Finally, we discuss the neurophysiological and computational significance of our results.},

This seemingly innocuous feature challenges our current understanding of the synaptic mechanisms underlying WM. Here we argue that in WM the prefrontal cortex (PFC) operates in a regime of balanced excitation and inhibition and that the observed temporal irregularity reflects this regime. We show that this requires that nonlinearities underlying the persistent activity are primarily in the neuronal interactions between PFC neurons. We also show that short-term synaptic facilitation can be the physiological substrate of these nonlinearities and that the resulting mechanism of balanced persistent activity is robust, in particular with respect to changes in the connectivity. As an example, we put forward a computational model of the PFC circuit involved in oculomotor delayed response task. The novelty of this model is that recurrent excitatory synapses are facilitating. We demonstrate that this model displays direction-selective persistent activity. We find that, even though the memory eventually degrades because of the heterogeneities, it can be stored for several seconds for plausible network size and connectivity. This model accounts for a large number of experimental findings, such as the findings that have shown that firing is more irregular during the persistent state than during baseline, that the neuronal responses are very diverse, and that the preferred directions during cue and delay periods are strongly correlated but tuning widths are not.},

The mechanism underlying orientation selectivity in V1 with such a salt-and-pepper organization is unknown; it is unclear whether a connectivity that depends on feature similarity is required, or a random connectivity suffices. Here we argue for the latter. We study the response to a drifting grating of a network model of layer 2/3 with random recurrent connectivity and feedforward input from layer 4 neurons with random preferred orientations. We show that even though the total feedforward and total recurrent excitatory and inhibitory inputs all have a very weak orientation selectivity, strong selectivity emerges in the neuronal spike responses if the network operates in the balanced excitation/inhibition regime. This is because in this regime the (large) untuned components in the excitatory and inhibitory contributions approximately cancel. As a result the untuned part of the input into a neuron as well as its modulation with orientation and time all have a size comparable to the neuronal threshold. However, the tuning of the F0 and F1 components of the input are uncorrelated and the high-frequency fluctuations are not tuned. This is reflected in the subthreshold voltage response. Remarkably, due to the nonlinear voltage-firing rate transfer function, the preferred orientation of the F0 and F1 components of the spike response are highly correlated.},

  abstract     = {Networks with continuous set of attractors are considered to be a paradigmatic model for parametric working memory (WM), but require fine tuning of connections and are thus structurally unstable. Here we analyzed the network with ring attractor, where connections are not perfectly tuned and the activity state therefore drifts in the absence of the stabilizing stimulus. We derive an analytical expression for the drift dynamics and conclude that the network cannot function as WM for a period of several seconds, a typical delay time in monkey memory experiments. We propose that short-term synaptic facilitation in recurrent connections significantly improves the robustness of the model by slowing down the drift of activity bump. Extending the calculation of the drift velocity to network with synaptic facilitation, we conclude that facilitation can slow down the drift by a large factor, rendering the network suitable as a model of WM.},

  abstract        = {Visually induced neuronal activity in V1 displays a marked gamma-band component which is modulated by stimulus properties. It has been argued that synchronized oscillations contribute to these gamma-band activity. However, analysis of Local Field Potentials (LFPs) across different experiments reveals considerable diversity in the degree of oscillatory behavior of this induced activity. Contrast-dependent power enhancements can indeed occur over a broad band in the gamma frequency range and spectral peaks may not arise at all. Furthermore, even when oscillations are observed, they undergo temporal decorrelation over very few cycles. This is not easily accounted for in previous network modeling of gamma oscillations. We argue here that interactions between cortical layers can be responsible for this fast decorrelation. We study a model of a V1 hypercolumn, embedding a simplified description of the multi-layered structure of the cortex. When the stimulus contrast is low, the induced activity is only weakly synchronous and the network resonates transiently without developing collective oscillations. When the contrast is high, on the other hand, the induced activity undergoes synchronous oscillations with an irregular spatiotemporal structure expressing a synchronous chaotic state. As a consequence the population activity undergoes fast temporal decorrelation, with concomitant rapid damping of the oscillations in LFPs autocorrelograms and peak broadening in LFPs power spectra. We show that the strength of the inter-layer coupling crucially affects this spatiotemporal structure. We predict that layer VI inactivation should induce global changes in the spectral properties of induced LFPs, reflecting their slower temporal decorrelation in the absence of inter-layer feedback. Finally, we argue that the mechanism underlying the emergence of synchronous chaos in our model is in fact very general. It stems from the fact that gamma oscillations induced by local delayed inhibition tend to develop chaos when coupled by sufficiently strong excitation.},

  abstract        = {We present results of an extensive numerical study of the dynamics of networks of integrate-and-fire neurons connected randomly through inhibitory interactions. We first consider delayed interactions with infinitely fast rise and decay. Depending on the parameters, the network displays transients which are short or exponentially long in the network size. At the end of these transients, the dynamics settle on a periodic attractor. If the number of connections per neuron is large ( approximately 1000) , this attractor is a cluster state with a short period. In contrast, if the number of connections per neuron is small ( approximately 100) , the attractor has complex dynamics and very long period. During the long transients the neurons fire in a highly irregular manner. They can be viewed as quasistationary states in which, depending on the coupling strength, the pattern of activity is asynchronous or displays population oscillations. In the first case, the average firing rates and the variability of the single-neuron activity are well described by a mean-field theory valid in the thermodynamic limit. Bifurcations of the long transient dynamics from asynchronous to synchronous activity are also well predicted by this theory. The transient dynamics display features reminiscent of stable chaos. In particular, despite being linearly stable, the trajectories of the transient dynamics are destabilized by finite perturbations as small as O(1/N) . We further show that stable chaos is also observed for postsynaptic currents with finite decay time. However, we report in this type of network that chaotic dynamics characterized by positive Lyapunov exponents can also be observed. We show in fact that chaos occurs when the decay time of the synaptic currents is long compared to the synaptic delay, provided that the network is sufficiently large.},

  abstract     = {In vivo and in vitro experimental studies have found that blocking electrical interactions connecting GABAergic interneurons reduces oscillatory activity in the gamma range in cortex. However, recent theoretical works have shown that the ability of electrical synapses to promote or impede synchrony, when alone, depends on their location on the dendritic tree of the neurons, the intrinsic properties of the neurons and the connectivity of the network. The goal of the present paper is to show that this versatility in the synchronizing ability of electrical synapses is greatly reduced when the neurons also interact via inhibition. To this end, we study a model network comprising two-compartment conductance-based neurons interacting with both types of synapses. We investigate the effect of electrical synapses on the dynamical state of the network as a function of the strength of the inhibition. We find that for weak inhibition, electrical synapses reinforce inhibition-generated synchrony only if they promote synchrony when they are alone. In contrast, when inhibition is sufficiently strong, electrical synapses improve synchrony even if when acting alone they would stabilize asynchronous firing. We clarify the mechanism underlying this cooperative interplay between electrical and inhibitory synapses. We show that it is relevant in two physiologically observed regimes: spike-to-spike synchrony, where neurons fire at almost every cycle of the population oscillations, and stochastic synchrony, where neurons fire irregularly and at a rate which is substantially lower than the frequency of the global population rhythm.},

  abstract        = {Cortical fast-spiking (FS) interneurons display highly variable electrophysiological properties. Their spike responses to step currents occur almost immediately following the step onset or after a substantial delay, during which subthreshold oscillations are frequently observed. Their firing patterns include high-frequency tonic firing and rhythmic or irregular bursting (stuttering). What is the origin of this variability? In the present paper, we hypothesize that it emerges naturally if one assumes a continuous distribution of properties in a small set of active channels. To test this hypothesis, we construct a minimal, single-compartment conductance-based model of FS cells that includes transient Na(+), delayed-rectifier K(+), and slowly inactivating d-type K(+) conductances. The model is analyzed using nonlinear dynamical system theory. For small Na(+) window current, the neuron exhibits high-frequency tonic firing. At current threshold, the spike response is almost instantaneous for small d-current conductance, gd, and it is delayed for larger gd. As gd further increases, the neuron stutters. Noise substantially reduces the delay duration and induces subthreshold oscillations. In contrast, when the Na(+) window current is large, the neuron always fires tonically. Near threshold, the firing rates are low, and the delay to firing is only weakly sensitive to noise; subthreshold oscillations are not observed. We propose that the variability in the response of cortical FS neurons is a consequence of heterogeneities in their gd and in the strength of their Na(+) window current. We predict the existence of two types of firing patterns in FS neurons, differing in the sensitivity of the delay duration to noise, in the minimal firing rate of the tonic discharge, and in the existence of subthreshold oscillations. We report experimental results from intracellular recordings supporting this prediction.},

  abstract        = {Parkinson's disease is known to result from basal ganglia dysfunction. Electrophysiological recordings in parkinsonian patients and animals have shown the emergence of abnormal synchronous oscillatory activity in the cortico-basal ganglia network in the pathological condition. In addition, previous studies pointed out an altered response pattern during movement execution in the pallidum of parkinsonian animals. To investigate the dynamics of these changes during disease progression and to relate them to the onset of the motor symptoms, we recorded spontaneous and movement-related neuronal activity in the internal pallidum of nonhuman primates during a progressive dopamine depletion process. Parkinsonian motor symptoms appeared progressively during the intoxication protocol, at the end of which both animals displayed severe akinesia, rigidity and postural abnormalities. Spontaneous firing rates did not vary significantly after intoxication. During the early phase of the protocol, voluntary movements were significantly slowed down and delayed. At the same time, the neuronal response to movement execution was modified and inhibitory responses disappeared. In contrast, the unitary and collective dynamic properties of spontaneous neuronal activity, as revealed by spectral and correlation analysis, remained unchanged during this period. Spontaneous correlated activity increased later, after animals became severely bradykinetic, whereas synchronous oscillatory activity appeared only after major motor symptoms developed. Thus, a causality between the emergence of synchronous oscillations in the pallidum and main parkinsonian motor symptoms seems unlikely. The pathological disruption of movement-related activity in the basal ganglia appears to be a better correlate at least to bradykinesia and stands as the best candidate to account for this motor symptom.},

In particular, BG neuronal activity in parkinsonian animals and patients is more oscillatory and more synchronous than in normal individuals. We propose a new model for the function and dysfunction of the motor part of BG. We hypothesize that the striatum, the subthalamic nucleus, the internal pallidum (GPi), the thalamus, and the cortex are involved in closed feedback loops. The direct (cortex-striatum-GPi-thalamus-cortex) and the hyperdirect loops (cortex-subthalamic nucleus-GPi-thalamus-cortex), which have different polarities, play a key role in the model. We show that the competition between these two loops provides the BG-cortex system with the ability to perform motor program selection. Under the assumption that dopamine potentiates corticostriatal synaptic transmission, we demonstrate that, in our model, moderate dopamine depletion leads to a complete loss of action selection ability. High depletion can lead to synchronous oscillations. These modifications of the network dynamical state stem from an imbalance between the feedback in the direct and hyperdirect loops when dopamine is depleted. Our model predicts that the loss of selection ability occurs before the appearance of oscillations, suggesting that Parkinson's disease motor impairments are not directly related to abnormal oscillatory activity. Another major prediction of our model is that synchronous oscillations driven by the hyperdirect loop appear in BG after inactivation of the striatum.},

  abstract        = {High frequency stimulation (HFS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a well-established therapeutic approach for the treatment of late-stage Parkinson's disease. Although the underlying cause of this illness remains a mystery, changes in firing rate and synchronized activity in different basal ganglia nuclei have been related to its symptoms. Here we investigated the impact of STN-HFS on firing rate as well as correlated and oscillatory activity in the STN network in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned non-human primates by using simultaneous extracellular single-unit recordings. STN-HFS reduced (i) the firing rate of STN neurons, (ii) the oscillatory activity at an individual STN neuron level as well as (iii) the correlated and oscillatory activity between pairs of STN neurons, while contralateral rigidity was improved. A detailed analysis showed that the decrease of mean firing rate resulted from the resetting of firing probability to virtually zero by the stimulus pulse. Subsequently, STN neurons resumed their activity after a mean duration of 2.9 +/- 0.1 ms and their firing probability returned to baseline values approximately 7 ms after the onset of the stimulus pulse, the recovery of the firing probability being represented by a sigmoid function. Thus, the overall decrease of the mean firing rate resulted from the repetition of this dynamical process with a frequency of 130 Hz (interstimulus interval approximately 7.7 ms), allowing the neuron to fire with its baseline firing rate only for a very short period. Although the mechanisms underlying the desynchronization of neuronal activity in the STN network remain unclear, the resetting of STN neuron firing probability by the electrical stimulus would rather be expected to increase oscillatory activity at an individual neuron level as well as correlated and oscillatory activity between pairs of STN neurons. However, assuming the resetting of firing rate to be the consequence of a transient GABAergic inhibition through excitation of presynaptic GABAergic axon terminals, different recovery periods of STN neurons might delay the appearance of synchronized oscillations, particularly if they are not generated locally. In conclusion, our study provides new evidence that STN-HFS decreases oscillatory activity in the STN network. Although the exact relation between oscillatory activity and Parkinson's disease symptoms remains to be determined, the present results suggest that STN-HFS might at least partially exert its beneficial effects through the reduction of oscillatory activity in the STN network and consequently in the entire cortex-basal ganglia-cortex network.},

  abstract        = {Recent experimental results have shown that GABAergic interneurons in the central nervous system are frequently connected via electrical synapses. Hence, depending on the area or the subpopulation, interneurons interact via inhibitory synapses or electrical synapses alone or via both types of interactions. The theoretical work presented here addresses the significance of these different modes of interactions for the interneuron networks dynamics. We consider the simplest system in which this issue can be investigated in models or in experiments: a pair of neurons, interacting via electrical synapses, inhibitory synapses, or both, and activated by the injection of a noisy external current. Assuming that the couplings and the noise are weak, we derive an analytical expression relating the cross-correlation (CC) of the activity of the two neurons to the phase response function of the neurons. When electrical and inhibitory interactions are not too strong, they combine their effect in a linear manner. In this regime, the effect of electrical and inhibitory interactions when combined can be deduced knowing the effects of each of the interactions separately. As a consequence, depending on intrinsic neuronal properties, electrical and inhibitory synapses may cooperate, both promoting synchrony, or may compete, with one promoting synchrony while the other impedes it. In contrast, for sufficiently strong couplings, the two types of synapses combine in a nonlinear fashion. Remarkably, we find that in this regime, combining electrical synapses with inhibition amplifies synchrony, whereas electrical synapses alone would desynchronize the activity of the neurons. We apply our theory to predict how the shape of the CC of two neurons changes as a function of ionic channel conductances, focusing on the effect of persistent sodium conductance, of the firing rate of the neurons and the nature and the strength of their interactions. These predictions may be tested using dynamic clamp techniques.},

  abstract        = {This study examines the ability of neurons to track temporally varying inputs, namely by investigating how the instantaneous firing rate of a neuron is modulated by a noisy input with a small sinusoidal component with frequency (f). Using numerical simulations of conductance-based neurons and analytical calculations of one-variable nonlinear integrate-and-fire neurons, we characterized the dependence of this modulation on f. For sufficiently high noise, the neuron acts as a low-pass filter. The modulation amplitude is approximately constant for frequencies up to a cutoff frequency, fc, after which it decays. The cutoff frequency increases almost linearly with the firing rate. For higher frequencies, the modulation amplitude decays as C/falpha, where the power alpha depends on the spike initiation mechanism. For conductance-based models, alpha = 1, and the prefactor C depends solely on the average firing rate and a spike "slope factor," which determines the sharpness of the spike initiation. These results are attributable to the fact that near threshold, the sodium activation variable can be approximated by an exponential function. Using this feature, we propose a simplified one-variable model, the "exponential integrate-and-fire neuron," as an approximation of a conductance-based model. We show that this model reproduces the dynamics of a simple conductance-based model extremely well. Our study shows how an intrinsic neuronal property (the characteristics of fast sodium channels) determines the speed with which neurons can track changes in input.},

  abstract        = {Population rate models provide powerful tools for investigating the principles that underlie the cooperative function of large neuronal systems. However, biophysical interpretations of these models have been ambiguous. Hence, their applicability to real neuronal systems and their experimental validation have been severely limited. In this work, we show that conductance-based models of large cortical neuronal networks can be described by simplified rate models, provided that the network state does not possess a high degree of synchrony. We first derive a precise mapping between the parameters of the rate equations and those of the conductance-based network models for time-independent inputs. This mapping is based on the assumption that the effect of increasing the cell's input conductance on its f-I curve is mainly subtractive. This assumption is confirmed by a single compartment Hodgkin-Huxley type model with a transient potassium A-current. This approach is applied to the study of a network model of a hypercolumn in primary visual cortex. We also explore extensions of the rate model to the dynamic domain by studying the firing-rate response of our conductance-based neuron to time-dependent noisy inputs. We show that the dynamics of this response can be approximated by a time-dependent second-order differential equation. This phenomenological single-cell rate model is used to calculate the response of a conductance-based network to time-dependent inputs.},

  abstract        = {Electrical synapses are ubiquitous in the mammalian CNS. Particularly in the neocortex, electrical synapses have been shown to connect low-threshold spiking (LTS) as well as fast spiking (FS) interneurons. Experiments have highlighted the roles of electrical synapses in the dynamics of neuronal networks. Here we investigate theoretically how intrinsic cell properties affect the synchronization of neurons interacting by electrical synapses. Numerical simulations of a network of conductance-based neurons randomly connected with electrical synapses show that potassium currents promote synchrony, whereas the persistent sodium current impedes it. Furthermore, synchrony varies with the firing rate in qualitatively different ways depending on the intrinsic currents. We also study analytically a network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons. We relate the stability of the asynchronous state of this network to the phase-response function (PRF), which characterizes the effect of small perturbations on the firing timing of the neurons. In particular, we show that the greater the skew of the PRF toward the first half of the period, the more stable the asynchronous state. Combining our simulations with our analytical results, we establish general rules to predict the dynamic state of large networks of neurons coupled with electrical synapses. Our work provides a natural explanation for surprising experimental observations that blocking electrical synapses may increase the synchrony of neuronal activity. It also suggests different synchronization properties for LTS and FS cells. Finally, we propose to further test our predictions in experiments using dynamic clamp techniques.},

This motion aftereffect likely arises across several visual areas from adaptive changes in the balance of activity and competitive interactions. We examined whether or not the mouse was susceptible to this same illusion to determine whether it would be a suitable model for learning about the neural representation of the motion aftereffect. Under a classical conditioning paradigm, mice learned to lick when presented with motion in one direction and not the opposite direction. When the mice were adapted to motion preceding this test, their lick behavior for zero coherence motion was biased for motion in the opposite direction of the adapting stimulus. Overall, lick count versus motion coherence shifted in the opposite direction of the adapting stimulus. This suggests that although the mouse has a simpler visual system compared with primates, it still is subject to the motion aftereffect and may elucidate the underlying circuitry.},

Here we describe and test the hypothesis that saccades are matched to natural scene statistics and to the receptive field sizes and adaptive properties of neural populations. Specifically, we determined the minimum amplitude of saccades in natural scenes necessary to provide uncorrelated inputs to model neural populations. This analysis predicts the distributions of observed saccade sizes during passive viewing for nonhuman primates, cats, and mice. Furthermore, disrupting the development of receptive field properties by monocular deprivation changed saccade sizes consistent with this hypothesis. Therefore, natural-scene statistics and the neural representation of natural images appear to be critical factors guiding saccadic eye movements.},

  abstract        = {Experiences during the critical period sculpt the circuitry within the neocortex, leading to changes in the functional responses of sensory neurons. Monocular deprivation (MD) during the visual critical period causes shifts in ocular preference, or dominance, toward the open eye in primary visual cortex (V1) and disrupts the normal development of acuity. In carnivores and primates, MD also disrupts the emergence of binocular disparity selectivity, a cue resulting from integrating ocular inputs. This disruption may be a result of the increase in neurons driven exclusively by the open eye that follows deprivation or a result of a mismatch in the convergence of ocular inputs. To distinguish between these possibilities, we measured the ocular dominance (OD) and disparity selectivity of neurons from male and female mouse V1 following MD. Normal mouse V1 neurons are dominated by contralateral eye input and contralateral eye deprivation shifts mouse V1 neurons toward more balanced responses between the eyes. This shift toward binocularity, as assayed by OD, decreased disparity sensitivity. MD did not alter the initial maturation of binocularity, as disparity selectivity before the MD was indistinguishable from normal mature animals. Decreased disparity tuning was most pronounced in binocular and ipsilaterally biased neurons, which are the populations that have undergone the largest shifts in OD. In concert with the decline in disparity selectivity, we observed a shift toward lower spatial frequency selectivity for the ipsilateral eye following MD. These results suggest an emergence of novel synaptic inputs during MD that disrupt the representation of disparity selectivity.  We demonstrate that monocular deprivation during the developmental critical period impairs binocular integration in mouse primary visual cortex. This impairment occurs despite an increase in the degree to which neurons become more binocular. We further demonstrate that our deprivation did not impair the maturation of disparity selectivity. Disparity selectivity has already reached a matured level before the monocular deprivation. The loss of disparity tuning is primarily observed in neurons dominated by the open eye, suggesting a link between altered inputs and loss of disparity sensitivity. These results suggest that new inputs following deprivation may not maintain the precise spatial relationship between the two eye inputs required for disparity selectivity.},

  abstract        = {Orientation selectivity in primary visual cortex (V1) has been proposed to reflect a canonical computation performed by the neocortical circuitry. Although orientation selectivity has been reported in all mammals examined to date, the degree of selectivity and the functional organization of selectivity vary across mammalian clades. The differences in degree of orientation selectivity are large, from reports in marsupials that only a small subset of neurons are selective to studies in carnivores, in which it is rare to find a neuron lacking selectivity. Furthermore, the functional organization in cortex varies in that the primate and carnivore V1 is characterized by an organization in which nearby neurons share orientation preference while other mammals such as rodents and lagomorphs either lack or have only extremely weak clustering. To gain insight into the evolutionary emergence of orientation selectivity, we examined the nine-banded armadillo, a species within the early placental clade Xenarthra. Here we use a combination of neuroimaging, histological, and electrophysiological methods to identify the retinofugal pathways, locate V1, and for the first time examine the functional properties of V1 neurons in the armadillo ( ) V1. Individual neurons were strongly sensitive to the orientation and often the direction of drifting gratings. We uncovered a wide range of orientation preferences but found a bias for horizontal gratings. The presence of strong orientation selectivity in armadillos suggests that the circuitry responsible for this computation is common to all placental mammals.  The current study shows that armadillo primary visual cortex (V1) neurons share the signature properties of V1 neurons of primates, carnivorans, and rodents. Furthermore, these neurons exhibit a degree of selectivity for stimulus orientation and motion direction similar to that found in primate V1. Our findings in armadillo visual cortex suggest that the functional properties of V1 neurons emerged early in the mammalian lineage, near the time of the divergence of marsupials.},

For example, many carnivores and primates possess a map for orientation selectivity in primary visual cortex (V1), whereas mice, rabbits, and the gray squirrel lack orientation maps. In this report we show that a carnivorous rodent with predatory behaviors, the grasshopper mouse ( , lacks a canonical columnar organization of orientation preference in V1; however, neighboring neurons within 50 μm exhibit related tuning preference. Using a combination of two-photon microscopy and extracellular electrophysiology, we demonstrate that the functional organization of visual cortical neurons in the grasshopper mouse is largely the same as in the C57/BL6 laboratory mouse. We also find similarity in the selectivity for stimulus orientation, direction, and spatial frequency. Our results suggest that the properties of V1 neurons across rodent species are largely conserved.  Carnivores and primates possess a map for orientation selectivity in primary visual cortex (V1), whereas rodents and lagomorphs lack this organization. We examine, for the first time, V1 of a wild carnivorous rodent with predatory behaviors, the grasshopper mouse ( ).

Orientation selectivity reflects a dramatic change in the representation of the visual world: Whereas afferent thalamic neurons are generally orientation insensitive, neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) are extremely sensitive to stimulus orientation. This profound change in the receptive field structure along the visual pathway has positioned V1 as a model system for studying the circuitry that underlies neural computations across the neocortex. The neocortex is characterized anatomically by the relative uniformity of its circuitry despite its role in processing distinct signals from region to region. A combination of physiological, anatomical, and theoretical studies has shed some light on the circuitry components necessary for generating orientation selectivity in V1. This targeted effort has led to critical insights, as well as controversies, concerning how neural circuits in the neocortex perform computations.},

  abstract        = {In vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in cat visual cortex revealed small deflections in the membrane potential of neurons, termed spikelets. Spikelet statistics and functional properties suggest these deflections originate from a single, nearby cell. Spikelets shared a number sensory selectivities with the principal neuron including orientation selectivity, receptive field location and eye preference. Principal neurons and spikelets did not, however, generally share preferences for depth (binocular disparity). Cross-correlation of spikelet activity and membrane potential revealed direct effects on the membrane potential of some principal neurons, suggesting that these cells were synaptically coupled or received common input from the cortical network. Other spikelet-neuron pairs revealed indirect effects, likely to be the result of correlated network events. Intracellular recordings in the neocortex reveal not only the membrane potential of neurons, but small unipolar or bipolar deflections that are termed spikelets. Spikelets have been proposed to originate from various sources, including active dendritic mechanisms, gap junctions and extracellular signals. Here we examined the functional characteristics of spikelets measured in neurons from cat primary visual cortex in vivo. Spiking statistics and our functional characterization of spikelet activity indicate that spikelets originate from a separate, nearby cell. Spikelet kinetics and lack of a direct effect on spikelet activity from hyperpolarizing current injection suggest they do not arise from electrical coupling to the principal neuron being recorded. Spikelets exhibited matched orientation tuning preference and ocular dominance to the principal neuron. In contrast, binocular disparity preferences of spikelets and the principal neuron were unrelated. Finally, we examined the impact of spikelets on the principal neuron's membrane potential; we did observe some records for which spikelets were correlated with the membrane potential of the principal neuron, suggesting that these neurons were synaptically coupled or received common input from the cortical network.},

Of particular interest are their roles in emergent cortical computations such as binocular integration in primary visual cortex (V1). We measured the binocular response selectivity of genetically defined subpopulations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Parvalbumin (PV+) interneurons received strong inputs from both eyes but lacked selectivity for binocular disparity. Because broad selectivity could result from heterogeneous synaptic input from neighboring neurons, we examined how individual PV+ interneuron selectivity compared to that of the local neuronal network, which is primarily composed of excitatory neurons. PV+ neurons showed functional similarity to neighboring neuronal populations over spatial distances resembling measurements of synaptic connectivity. On the other hand, excitatory neurons expressing CaMKIIα displayed no such functional similarity with the neighboring population. Our findings suggest that broad selectivity of PV+ interneurons results from nonspecific integration within local networks. VIDEO ABSTRACT.},

  abstract        = {Smooth pursuit eye movements stabilize slow-moving objects on the retina by matching eye velocity with target velocity. Two critical components are required to generate smooth pursuit: first, because it is a voluntary eye movement, the subject must select a target to pursue to engage the tracking system; and second, generating smooth pursuit requires a moving stimulus. We examined whether this behavior also exists in the common marmoset, a New World primate that is increasingly attracting attention as a genetic model for mental disease and systems neuroscience. We measured smooth pursuit in two marmosets, previously trained to perform fixation tasks, using the standard Rashbass step-ramp pursuit paradigm. We first measured the aspects of visual motion that drive pursuit eye movements. Smooth eye movements were in the same direction as target motion, indicating that pursuit was driven by target movement rather than by displacement. Both the open-loop acceleration and closed-loop eye velocity exhibited a linear relationship with target velocity for slow-moving targets, but this relationship declined for higher speeds. We next examined whether marmoset pursuit eye movements depend on an active engagement of the pursuit system by measuring smooth eye movements evoked by small perturbations of motion from fixation or during pursuit. Pursuit eye movements were much larger during pursuit than from fixation, indicating that pursuit is actively gated. Several practical advantages of the marmoset brain, including the accessibility of the middle temporal (MT) area and frontal eye fields at the cortical surface, merit its utilization for studying pursuit movements.},

Yet it is activity, derived from the experience of interacting with the world, that sculpts the precise circuitry of the central nervous system. Such experience-dependent plasticity has been observed throughout the brain but has been most extensively studied in the neocortex. A prime example of this refinement of neural circuitry is found in primary visual cortex (V1), where functional connectivity changes have been observed both during development and in adulthood. The mouse visual system has become a predominant model for investigating the principles that underlie experience-dependent plasticity, given the general conservation of visual neural circuitry across mammals as well as the powerful tools and techniques recently developed for use in rodent. The genetic tractability of mice has permitted the identification of signaling pathways that translate experience-driven activity patterns into changes in circuitry. Further, the accessibility of visual cortex has allowed neural activity to be manipulated with optogenetics and observed with genetically-encoded calcium sensors. Consequently, mouse visual cortex has become one of the dominant platforms to study experience-dependent plasticity.},

  abstract        = {In the mammalian cerebral cortex, neural responses are highly variable during spontaneous activity and sensory stimulation. To explain this variability, the cortex of alert animals has been proposed to be in an asynchronous high-conductance state in which irregular spiking arises from the convergence of large numbers of uncorrelated excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto individual neurons. Signatures of this state are that a neuron's membrane potential (Vm) hovers just below spike threshold, and its aggregate synaptic input is nearly Gaussian, arising from many uncorrelated inputs. Alternatively, irregular spiking could arise from infrequent correlated input events that elicit large fluctuations in Vm (refs 5, 6). To distinguish between these hypotheses, we developed a technique to perform whole-cell Vm measurements from the cortex of behaving monkeys, focusing on primary visual cortex (V1) of monkeys performing a visual fixation task. Here we show that, contrary to the predictions of an asynchronous state, mean Vm during fixation was far from threshold (14 mV) and spiking was triggered by occasional large spontaneous fluctuations. Distributions of Vm values were skewed beyond that expected for a range of Gaussian input, but were consistent with synaptic input arising from infrequent correlated events. Furthermore, spontaneous fluctuations in Vm were correlated with the surrounding network activity, as reflected in simultaneously recorded nearby local field potential. Visual stimulation, however, led to responses more consistent with an asynchronous state: mean Vm approached threshold, fluctuations became more Gaussian, and correlations between single neurons and the surrounding network were disrupted. These observations show that sensory drive can shift a common cortical circuitry from a synchronous to an asynchronous state.},

  abstract        = {Visual disruption early in development dramatically changes how primary visual cortex neurons integrate binocular inputs. The disruption is paradigmatic for investigating the synaptic basis of long-term changes in cortical function, because the primary visual cortex is the site of binocular convergence. The underlying alterations in circuitry by visual disruption remain poorly understood. Here we compare membrane potential responses, observed via whole-cell recordings in vivo, of primary visual cortex neurons in normal adult cats with those of cats in which strabismus was induced before the developmental critical period. In strabismic cats, we observed a dramatic shift in the ocular dominance distribution of simple cells, the first stage of visual cortical processing, toward responding to one eye instead of both, but not in complex cells, which receive inputs from simple cells. Both simple and complex cells no longer conveyed the binocular information needed for depth perception based on binocular cues. There was concomitant binocular suppression such that responses were weaker with binocular than with monocular stimulation. Our estimates of the excitatory and inhibitory input to single neurons indicate binocular suppression that was not evident in synaptic excitation, but arose de novo because of synaptic inhibition. Further constraints on circuit models of plasticity result from indications that the ratio of excitation to inhibition evoked by monocular stimulation decreased mainly for nonpreferred eye stimulation. Although we documented changes in synaptic input throughout primary visual cortex, a circuit model with plasticity at only thalamocortical synapses is sufficient to account for our observations.},

In carnivores and primates, elongated receptive fields first appear in V1, whereas in lagomorphs such receptive fields emerge earlier, in the retina. Here we examine the mouse visual pathway and reveal the existence of orientation selectivity in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) relay cells. Cortical inactivation does not reduce this orientation selectivity, indicating that cortical feedback is not its source. Orientation selectivity is similar for LGN relay cells spiking and subthreshold input to V1 neurons, suggesting that cortical orientation selectivity is inherited from the LGN in mouse. In contrast, orientation selectivity of cat LGN relay cells is small relative to subthreshold inputs onto V1 simple cells. Together, these differences show that although orientation selectivity exists in visual neurons of both rodents and carnivores, its emergence along the visual pathway, and thus its underlying neuronal circuitry, is fundamentally different.},

In many mammals, this binocular integration is an important first step in the development of stereopsis, the perception of depth from disparity. Neurons in the binocular zone of mouse V1 receive inputs from both eyes, but it is unclear how that binocular information is integrated and whether this integration has a function similar to that found in other mammals. Using extracellular recordings, we demonstrate that mouse V1 neurons are tuned for binocular disparities, or spatial differences, between the inputs from each eye, thus extracting signals potentially useful for estimating depth. The disparities encoded by mouse V1 are significantly larger than those encoded by cat and primate. Interestingly, these larger disparities correspond to distances that are likely to be ecologically relevant in natural viewing, given the stereo-geometry of the mouse visual system. Across mammalian species, it appears that binocular integration is a common cortical computation used to extract information relevant for estimating depth. As such, it is a prime example of how the integration of multiple sensory signals is used to generate accurate estimates of properties in our environment.},

  abstract        = {Orientation selectivity in the primary visual cortex (V1) is a receptive field property that is at once simple enough to make it amenable to experimental and theoretical approaches and yet complex enough to represent a significant transformation in the representation of the visual image. As a result, V1 has become an area of choice for studying cortical computation and its underlying mechanisms. Here we consider the receptive field properties of the simple cells in cat V1--the cells that receive direct input from thalamic relay cells--and explore how these properties, many of which are highly nonlinear, arise. We have found that many receptive field properties of V1 simple cells fall directly out of Hubel and Wiesel's feedforward model when the model incorporates realistic neuronal and synaptic mechanisms, including threshold, synaptic depression, response variability, and the membrane time constant.},

In cat primary visual cortex (V1), for example, neurons are able to extract stimulus features like orientation or spatial configuration over a wide range of stimulus contrasts. The contrast-invariant spatial tuning found in V1 neuron responses has been modeled as a gain control mechanism, but at which stage of the visual pathway it emerges has remained unclear. Here we describe our findings that contrast-invariant spatial tuning occurs not only in the responses of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) relay cells but also in their afferent retinal input. Our evidence suggests that a similar contrast-invariant mechanism is found throughout the stages of the early visual pathway, and that the contrast-invariant spatial selectivity is evident in both retinal ganglion cell and LGN cell responses.},

Action potentials, however, are only indirectly related to the synaptic inputs that determine the underlying, subthreshold, response selectivity. We present a method to predict membrane potential, the measurable result of the convergence of synaptic inputs, based on spike rate alone and then test its utility by comparing predictions to actual membrane potential recordings from simple cells in primary visual cortex. Using a noise stimulus, we found that spike rate receptive fields were in precise correspondence with membrane potential receptive fields (R(2) = 0.74). On average, spike rate alone could predict 44% of membrane potential fluctuations to dynamic noise stimuli, demonstrating the utility of this method to extract estimates of subthreshold responses. We also found that the nonlinear relationship between membrane potential and spike rate could also be extracted from spike rate data alone by comparing predictions from the noise stimulus with the actual spike rate. Our analysis reveals that linear receptive field models extracted from noise stimuli accurately reflect the underlying membrane potential selectivity and thus represent a method to generate estimates of the underlying average membrane potential from spike rate data alone.},

In this study, we used repetitive click trains to describe the spatial distribution of RRTF responses in cat anterior auditory field (AAF) and to discern potential variations in local temporal processing capacity. A majority of RRTF filters are band-pass. Temporal parameters estimated from RRTFs and corrected for characteristic frequency or latency dependencies are non-homogeneously distributed across AAF. Unlike the shallow global gradient observed in spectral receptive field parameters, transitions from loci with high to low temporal parameters are steep. Quantitative spatial analysis suggests non-uniform, circumscribed local organization for temporal pattern processing superimposed on global organization for spectral processing in cat AAF.},

The emergence of orientation selectivity in V1 has long served as a model for investigating cortical computation. Recent evidence for orientation selectivity in mouse V1 opens cortical computation to dissection by genetic and imaging tools, but also raises two essential questions: (1) How does orientation selectivity in mouse V1 neurons compare with that in previously described species? (2) What is the synaptic basis for orientation selectivity in mouse V1? A comparison of orientation selectivity in mouse and in cat, where such measures have traditionally been made, reveals that orientation selectivity in mouse V1 is weaker than in cat V1, but that spike threshold plays a similar role in narrowing selectivity between membrane potential and spike rate. To uncover the synaptic basis for orientation selectivity, we made whole-cell recordings in vivo from mouse V1 neurons, comparing neuronal input selectivity-based on membrane potential, synaptic excitation, and synaptic inhibition-to output selectivity based on spiking. We found that a neuron's excitatory and inhibitory inputs are selective for the same stimulus orientations as is its membrane potential response, and that inhibitory selectivity is not broader than excitatory selectivity. Inhibition has different dynamics than excitation, adapting more rapidly. In neurons with temporally modulated responses, the timing of excitation and inhibition was different in mice and cats.},

  abstract        = {In contrast to neurons of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) are selective for the direction of visual motion. Cortical direction selectivity could emerge from the spatiotemporal configuration of inputs from thalamic cells, from intracortical inhibitory interactions, or from a combination of thalamic and intracortical interactions. To distinguish between these possibilities, we studied the effect of adaptation (prolonged visual stimulation) on the direction selectivity of intracellularly recorded cortical neurons. It is known that adaptation selectively reduces the responses of cortical neurons, while largely sparing the afferent LGN input. Adaptation can therefore be used as a tool to dissect the relative contribution of afferent and intracortical interactions to the generation of direction selectivity. In both simple and complex cells, adaptation caused a hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential (-2.5 mV, simple cells, -0.95 mV complex cells). In simple cells, adaptation in either direction only slightly reduced the visually evoked depolarization; this reduction was similar for preferred and null directions. In complex cells, adaptation strongly reduced visual responses in a direction-dependent manner: the reduction was largest when the stimulus direction matched that of the adapting motion. As a result, adaptation caused changes in the direction selectivity of complex cells: direction selectivity was reduced after preferred direction adaptation and increased after null direction adaptation. Because adaptation in the null direction enhanced direction selectivity rather than reduced it, it seems unlikely that inhibition from the null direction is the primary mechanism for creating direction selectivity.},

Low-rate repetitive sounds are elemental features of communication sounds, and core auditory cortical regions have been implicated in processing these information-bearing elements. Repetitive sounds could be encoded by at least three neural response properties: 1) the event-locked spike-timing precision, 2) the mean firing rate, and 3) the interspike interval (ISI). To determine how well these response aspects capture information about the repetition rate stimulus, we measured local group responses of cortical neurons in cat anterior auditory field (AAF) to click trains and calculated their mutual information based on these different codes. ISIs of the multiunit responses carried substantially higher information about low repetition rates than either spike-timing precision or firing rate. Combining firing rate and ISI codes was synergistic and captured modestly more repetition information. Spatial distribution analyses showed distinct local clustering properties for each encoding scheme for repetition information indicative of a place code. Diversity in local processing emphasis and distribution of different repetition rate codes across AAF may give rise to concurrent feed-forward processing streams that contribute differently to higher-order sound analysis.},

We measured neural variability in 13 extracellularly recorded datasets and one intracellularly recorded dataset from seven areas spanning the four cortical lobes in monkeys and cats. In every case, stimulus onset caused a decline in neural variability. This occurred even when the stimulus produced little change in mean firing rate. The variability decline was observed in membrane potential recordings, in the spiking of individual neurons and in correlated spiking variability measured with implanted 96-electrode arrays. The variability decline was observed for all stimuli tested, regardless of whether the animal was awake, behaving or anaesthetized. This widespread variability decline suggests a rather general property of cortex, that its state is stabilized by an input.},

Estimates of OD, commonly used to quantify the right and left eye synaptic inputs, have previously been based on spike rate. Membrane potential (V(m)), however, is more closely related to the synaptic inputs onto neurons and should therefore more closely reflect the degree of input from the two eyes. To determine the relationship between OD based on membrane potential and on spike rate, intracellular recordings were made from visual cortical neurons. OD based on spike rate was systematically more monocular than OD based on membrane potential. The discrepancy between membrane-potential OD and spike-rate OD may be accounted for by a simple model of V(m)-to-spike-rate transformation.},

  abstract        = {In simple cells of the cat primary visual cortex, null-oriented stimuli, which by themselves evoke no response, can completely suppress the spiking response to optimally oriented stimuli. This cross-orientation suppression has been interpreted as evidence for cross-orientation inhibition: synaptic inhibition among cortical cells with different preferred orientations. In intracellular recordings from simple cells, however, we found that cross-oriented stimuli suppressed, rather than enhanced, synaptic inhibition and, at the same time, suppressed synaptic excitation. Much of the suppression of excitation could be accounted for by the behavior of geniculate relay cells: contrast saturation and rectification in relay cell responses, when applied to a linear feed-forward model, predicted cross-orientation suppression of the modulation (F1) component of excitation evoked in simple cells. In addition, we found that the suppression of the spike output of simple cells was almost twice the suppression of their synaptic inputs. Thus, cross-orientation suppression, like orientation selectivity, is strongly amplified by threshold.},

  abstract        = {We recorded the responses of direction-selective simple and complex cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) of anesthetized, paralyzed macaque monkeys. When studied with sine-wave gratings, almost all simple cells in V1 had responses that were separable for spatial and temporal frequency: the preferred temporal frequency did not change and preferred speed decreased as a function of the spatial frequency of the grating. As in previous recordings from the middle temporal visual area (MT), approximately one-quarter of V1 complex cells had separable responses to spatial and temporal frequency, and one-quarter were "speed tuned" in the sense that preferred speed did not change as a function of spatial frequency. Half fell between these two extremes. Reducing the contrast of the gratings caused the population of V1 complex cells to become more separable in their tuning for spatial and temporal frequency. Contrast dependence is explained by the contrast gain of the neurons, which was relatively higher for gratings that were either both of high or both of low temporal and spatial frequency. For stimuli that comprised two spatially superimposed sine-wave gratings, the preferred speeds and tuning bandwidths of V1 neurons could be predicted from the sum of the responses to the component gratings presented alone, unlike neurons in MT that showed nonlinear interactions. We conclude that spatiotemporal modulation of contrast gain creates speed tuning from separable inputs in V1 complex cells. Speed tuning in MT could be primarily inherited from V1, but processing that occurs after V1 and possibly within MT computes selective combinations of speed-tuned signals of special relevance for downstream perceptual and motor mechanisms.},

Apparent motion consisted of multiple stationary stimulus flashes presented in sequence, characterized by their temporal separation (delta t) and spatial separation (delta x). Stimuli were 8 degrees square patterns of 100% correlated random dots that moved at apparent speeds of 16 or 32 degrees/s. For both V1 and MT, the difference between the response to the preferred and null directions declined with increasing flash separation. For each neuron, we estimated the maximum flash separation for which directionally selective responses were observed. For the range of speeds we used, delta x provided a better description of the limitation on directional responses than did delta t. When comparing MT and V1 neurons of similar preferred speed, there was no difference in the maximum delta x between our samples from the two areas. In both V1 and MT, the great majority of neurons had maximal values of delta x in the 0.25-1 degrees range. Mean values were almost identical between the two areas. For most neurons, larger flash separations led to both weaker responses to the preferred direction and increased responses to the opposite direction. The former mechanism was slightly more dominant in MT and the latter slightly more dominant in V1. We conclude that V1 and MT neurons lose direction selectivity for similar values of delta x, supporting the hypothesis that basic direction selectivity in MT is inherited from V1, at least over the range of stimulus speeds represented by both areas.},

They receive largely independent, concurrent thalamocortical projections from the different thalamic divisions despite their hierarchical equivalency. The parallel streams of thalamic inputs to AAF and AI suggest that AAF neurons may differ from AI neurons in physiological properties. Although a modular functional organization in cat AI has been well documented, little is known about the internal organization of AAF beyond tonotopy. We studied how basic receptive field parameters (RFPs) are spatially organized in AAF with single- and multiunit recording techniques. A distorted tonotopicity with an underrepresentation in midfrequencies (1 and 5 kHz) and an overrepresentation in the high-frequency range was found. Spectral bandwidth (Q-values) and response threshold were significantly correlated with characteristic frequency (CF). To understand whether AAF has a modular organization of RFPs, CF dependencies were eliminated by a nonparametric, local regression model, and the residuals (difference between the model and observed values) were evaluated. In a given isofrequency domain, clusters of low or high residual RFP values were interleaved for threshold, spectral bandwidth, and latency, suggesting a modular organization. However, RFP modules in AAF were not expressed as robustly as in AI. A comparison of RFPs between AAF and AI shows that AAF neurons were more broadly tuned and had shorter latencies than AI neurons. These physiological field differences are consistent with anatomical evidence of largely independent, concurrent thalamocortical projections in AI and AAF, which strongly suggest field-specific processing.},

In the domain of visual motion, estimates of target speed are derived from the responses of motion-sensitive neurons in the middle temporal (MT) area of the extrastriate visual cortex and are used to drive smooth pursuit eye movements and perceptual judgments of speed. We have asked how these behavioral systems estimate target speed from the population response in area MT. We found that increasing the spatial frequency of a sine wave grating caused decreases in the target speed estimated by both pursuit and perception and commensurate changes in the identity of the active neurons in area MT. Decreasing the contrast of a sine wave grating caused decreases in the target speed estimated by both pursuit and perception, while altering only the response amplitude of MT neurons and not the identity of the active neurons. Applying a modified vector-averaging computation to the population response measured in area MT allowed us to predict the effects of both spatial frequency and contrast on speed estimation for both perception and pursuit. The modification biased the speed estimation toward low target speeds when responses across the population of neurons were small.},

The present paper asks whether speed is coded in a way that is invariant to the shape of the moving stimulus, and if so, how. When tested with single sine-wave gratings of different spatial and temporal frequencies, MT neurons show a continuum in the degree to which preferred speed depends on spatial frequency. There is some dependence in 75% of MT neurons, and the other 25% maintain speed tuning despite changes in spatial frequency. When tested with stimuli constructed by adding two superimposed sine-wave gratings, the preferred speed of MT neurons becomes less dependent on spatial frequency. Analysis of these responses reveals a speed-tuning nonlinearity that selectively enhances the responses of the neuron when multiple spatial frequencies are present and moving at the same speed. Consistent with the presence of the nonlinearity, MT neurons show speed tuning that is close to form-invariant when the moving stimuli comprise square-wave gratings, which contain multiple spatial frequencies moving at the same speed. We conclude that the neural circuitry in and before MT makes no explicit attempt to render MT neurons speed-tuned for sine-wave gratings, which do not occur in natural scenes. Instead, MT neurons derive form-invariant speed tuning in a way that takes advantage of the multiple spatial frequencies that comprise moving objects in natural scenes.},

Both pursuit and perceptual direction discrimination rely on signals from the middle temporal visual area (MT), yet analysis of multiple measures of MT neuronal responses in the macaque failed to provide evidence of a directional anisotropy. We conclude that MT represents different motion directions uniformly, and subsequent processing creates a directional anisotropy in pathways unique to perception. Our data support the hypothesis that, at least for visual motion, perception and action are guided by inputs from separate sensory streams. The directional anisotropy of perception appears to originate after the two streams have segregated and downstream from area MT.},

  abstract        = {Neurons in area MT, a motion-sensitive area of extrastriate cortex, respond to a step of target velocity with a transient-sustained firing pattern. The transition from a high initial firing rate to a lower sustained rate occurs over a time course of 20-80 ms and is considered a form of short-term adaptation. The present paper asks whether adaptation is due to input-specific mechanisms such as short-term synaptic depression or if it results from intrinsic cellular mechanisms such as spike-rate adaptation. We assessed the contribution of input-specific mechanisms by using a condition/test paradigm to measure the spatial scale of adaptation. Conditioning and test stimuli were placed within MT receptive fields but were spatially segregated so that the two stimuli would activate different populations of inputs from the primary visual cortex (V1). Conditioning motion at one visual location caused a reduction of the transient firing to subsequent test motion at a second location. The adaptation field, estimated as the region of visual space where conditioning motion caused adaptation, was always larger than the MT receptive field. Use of the same stimulus configuration while recording from direction-selective neurons in V1 failed to demonstrate either adaptation or the transient-sustained response pattern that is the signature of short-term adaptation in MT. We conclude that the shift from transient to sustained firing in MT cells does not result from an input-specific mechanism applied to inputs from V1 because it operates over a wider range of the visual field than is covered by receptive fields of V1 neurons. We used a direct analysis of MT neuron spike trains for many repetitions of the same motion stimulus to assess the contribution to adaptation of intrinsic cellular mechanisms related to spiking. On a trial-by-trial basis, there was no correlation between number of spikes in the transient interval and the interval immediately after the transient period. This is opposite the prediction that there should be a correlation if spikes cause adaptation directly. Further, the transient was suppressed or extinguished, not delayed, in trials in which the neuron emitted zero spikes during the interval that showed a transient in average firing rate. We conclude that the transition from transient to sustained firing in neurons in area MT is caused by mechanisms that are neither input-specific nor controlled by the spiking of the adapting neuron. We propose that the short-term adaptation observed in area MT emerges from the intracortical circuit within MT.},

  abstract        = {Neurons in area MT, a motion-sensitive area of extrastriate cortex, respond to a step of target velocity with a transient-sustained firing pattern. The transition from a high initial firing rate to a lower sustained rate occurs over a time course of 20-80 ms and is considered a form of short-term adaptation. In the present paper, we compared the tuning of the adaptation to the neuron's tuning to direction and speed. The tuning of adaptation was measured with a condition/test paradigm in which a testing motion of the preferred direction and speed of the neuron under study was preceded by a conditioning motion: the direction and speed of the conditioning motion were varied systematically. The response to the test motion depended strongly on the direction of the conditioning motion. It was suppressed in almost all neurons by conditioning motion in the same direction and could be either suppressed or enhanced by conditioning motion in the opposite direction. Even in neurons that showed suppression for target motion in the nonpreferred direction, the adaptation and response direction tuning were the same. The speed tuning of adaptation was linked much less tightly to the speed tuning of the response of the neuron under study. For just more than 50% of neurons, the preferred speed of adaptation was more than 1 log unit different from the preferred response speed. Many neurons responded best when slow motions were followed by faster motions (acceleration) or vice versa (deceleration), suggesting that MT neurons may encode information about the change of target velocity over time. Finally, adaptation by conditioning motions of different directions, but not different speeds, altered the latency of the response to the test motion. The adaptation of latency recovered with shorter intervals between the conditioning and test motions than did the adaptation of response size, suggesting that latency and amplitude adaptation are mediated by separate mechanisms. Taken together with the companion paper, our data suggest that short-term motion adaptation in MT is a consequence of the neural circuit in MT and is not mediated by either input-specific mechanisms or intrinsic mechanisms related to the spiking of individual neurons. The circuit responsible for adaptation is tuned for both speed and direction and has the same direction tuning as the circuit responsible for the initial response of MT neurons.},

Here we present bio-compatible sensors based on Giant Magneto-Resistance (GMR) spin electronics. We show on a mouse muscle in vitro, using electrophysiology and computational modeling, that this technology permits simultaneous local recordings of the magnetic fields from action potentials. The sensitivity of this type of sensor is almost size independent, allowing the miniaturization and shaping required for in vivo/vitro magnetophysiology. GMR-based technology can constitute the magnetic counterpart of microelectrodes in electrophysiology, and might represent a new fundamental tool to investigate the local sources of neuronal magnetic activity.},

In many situations, especially in vivo, the traditional limitation of such recordings is the high electrode resistance and capacitance, which may cause significant measurement errors during current injection. We introduce a computer-aided technique, Active Electrode Compensation (AEC), based on a digital model of the electrode interfaced in real time with the electrophysiological setup. The characteristics of this model are first estimated using white noise current injection. The electrode and membrane contribution are digitally separated, and the recording is then made by online subtraction of the electrode contribution. Tests performed in vitro and in vivo demonstrate that AEC enables high-frequency recordings in demanding conditions, such as injection of conductance noise in dynamic-clamp mode, not feasible with a single high-resistance electrode until now. AEC should be particularly useful to characterize fast neuronal phenomena intracellularly in vivo.},

  abstract        = {Cortical neurons are subject to sustained and irregular synaptic activity which causes important fluctuations of the membrane potential (V(m)). We review here different methods to characterize this activity and its impact on spike generation. The simplified, fluctuating point-conductance model of synaptic activity provides the starting point of a variety of methods for the analysis of intracellular V(m) recordings. In this model, the synaptic excitatory and inhibitory conductances are described by Gaussian-distributed stochastic variables, or "colored conductance noise". The matching of experimentally recorded V(m) distributions to an invertible theoretical expression derived from the model allows the extraction of parameters characterizing the synaptic conductance distributions. This analysis can be complemented by the matching of experimental V(m) power spectral densities (PSDs) to a theoretical template, even though the unexpected scaling properties of experimental PSDs limit the precision of this latter approach. Building on this stochastic characterization of synaptic activity, we also propose methods to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate spike-triggered averages of synaptic time-courses preceding spikes. This analysis points to an essential role for synaptic conductance variance in determining spike times. The presented methods are evaluated using controlled conductance injection in cortical neurons in vitro with the dynamic-clamp technique. We review their applications to the analysis of in vivo intracellular recordings in cat association cortex, which suggest a predominant role for inhibition in determining both sub- and supra-threshold dynamics of cortical neurons embedded in active networks.},

These four classes are "fast spiking", "regular spiking", "intrinsically bursting" and "low-threshold spike" cells. For each class, we fit "minimal" HH type models to experimental data. The models contain the minimal set of voltage-dependent currents to account for the data. To obtain models as generic as possible, we used data from different preparations in vivo and in vitro, such as rat somatosensory cortex and thalamus, guinea-pig visual and frontal cortex, ferret visual cortex, cat visual cortex and cat association cortex. For two cell classes, we used automatic fitting procedures applied to several cells, which revealed substantial cell-to-cell variability within each class. The selection of such cellular models constitutes a necessary step towards building network simulations of the thalamocortical system with realistic cellular dynamical properties.},

This activity contains information about the underlying network dynamics, but it is not easy to extract network properties from such complex and irregular activity. Here, we propose a method to estimate properties of network activity from intracellular recordings and test this method using theoretical and experimental approaches. The method is based on the analytic expression of the subthreshold V(m) distribution at steady state in conductance-based models. Fitting this analytic expression to V(m) distributions obtained from intracellular recordings provides estimates of the mean and variance of excitatory and inhibitory conductances. We test the accuracy of these estimates against computational models of increasing complexity. We also test the method using dynamic-clamp recordings of neocortical neurons in vitro. By using an on-line analysis procedure, we show that the measured conductances from spontaneous network activity can be used to re-create artificial states equivalent to real network activity. This approach should be applicable to intracellular recordings during different network states in vivo, providing a characterization of the global properties of synaptic conductances and possible insight into the underlying network mechanisms.},

We find that neural tissue has marked non-ohmic and frequency-filtering properties, which are not consistent with a resistive (ohmic) medium, as often assumed. The amplitude and phase profiles of the measured impedance are consistent with the contribution of ionic diffusion. We also show that the impact of such frequency-filtering properties is possibly important on the genesis of local field potentials, as well as on the cable properties of neurons. These results show non-ohmic properties of the extracellular medium around neurons, and suggest that source estimation methods, as well as the cable properties of neurons, which all assume ohmic extracellular medium, may need to be reevaluated.},

  abstract        = {The thalamus is the primary gateway that relays sensory information to the cerebral cortex. While a single recipient cortical cell receives the convergence of many principal relay cells of the thalamus, each thalamic cell in turn integrates a dense and distributed synaptic feedback from the cortex. During sensory processing, the influence of this functional loop remains largely ignored. Using dynamic-clamp techniques in thalamic slices in vitro, we combined theoretical and experimental approaches to implement a realistic hybrid retino-thalamo-cortical pathway mixing biological cells and simulated circuits. The synaptic bombardment of cortical origin was mimicked through the injection of a stochastic mixture of excitatory and inhibitory conductances, resulting in a gradable correlation level of afferent activity shared by thalamic cells. The study of the impact of the simulated cortical input on the global retinocortical signal transfer efficiency revealed a novel control mechanism resulting from the collective resonance of all thalamic relay neurons. We show here that the transfer efficiency of sensory input transmission depends on three key features: i) the number of thalamocortical cells involved in the many-to-one convergence from thalamus to cortex, ii) the statistics of the corticothalamic synaptic bombardment and iii) the level of correlation imposed between converging thalamic relay cells. In particular, our results demonstrate counterintuitively that the retinocortical signal transfer efficiency increases when the level of correlation across thalamic cells decreases. This suggests that the transfer efficiency of relay cells could be selectively amplified when they become simultaneously desynchronized by the cortical feedback. When applied to the intact brain, this network regulation mechanism could direct an attentional focus to specific thalamic subassemblies and select the appropriate input lines to the cortex according to the descending influence of cortically-defined "priors".},

  abstract        = {A reason why the thalamus is more than a passive gateway for sensory signals is that two-third of the synapses of thalamocortical neurons are directly or indirectly related to the activity of corticothalamic axons. While the responses of thalamocortical neurons evoked by sensory stimuli are well characterized, with ON- and OFF-center receptive field structures, the prevalence of synaptic noise resulting from neocortical feedback in intracellularly recorded thalamocortical neurons in vivo has attracted little attention. However, in vitro and modeling experiments point to its critical role for the integration of sensory signals. Here we combine our recent findings in a unified framework suggesting the hypothesis that corticothalamic synaptic activity is adapted to modulate the transfer efficiency of thalamocortical neurons during selective attention at three different levels: First, on ionic channels by interacting with intrinsic membrane properties, second at the neuron level by impacting on the input-output gain, and third even more effectively at the cell assembly level by boosting the information transfer of sensory features encoded in thalamic subnetworks. This top-down population control is achieved by tuning the correlations in subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations and is adapted to modulate the transfer of sensory features encoded by assemblies of thalamocortical relay neurons. We thus propose that cortically-controlled (de-)correlation of subthreshold noise is an efficient and swift dynamic mechanism for selective attention in the thalamus.},

  abstract        = {How intracortical recurrent circuits in mammalian sensory cortex influence dynamics of sensory representation is not understood. Previous methods could not distinguish the relative contributions of recurrent circuits and thalamic afferents to cortical dynamics. We accomplish this by optogenetically manipulating thalamus and cortex. Over the initial 40 ms of visual stimulation, excitation from recurrent circuits in visual cortex progressively increased to exceed direct thalamocortical excitation. Even when recurrent excitation exceeded thalamic excitation, upon silencing thalamus, sensory-evoked activity in cortex decayed rapidly, with a time constant of 10 ms, which is similar to a neuron's integration time window. In awake mice, this cortical decay function predicted the time-locking of cortical activity to thalamic input at frequencies <15 Hz and attenuation of the cortical response to higher frequencies. Under anesthesia, depression at thalamocortical synapses disrupted the fidelity of sensory transmission. Thus, we determine dynamics intrinsic to cortical recurrent circuits that transform afferent input in time.},

Typically, thalamocortical neurons possess two distinct firing modes. At depolarized membrane potentials, thalamic cells fire single action potentials and faithfully relay synaptic inputs to the cortex. At hyperpolarized potentials, the activation of T-type calcium channels promotes burst firing, and the transfer is less accurate. Our results suggest that this duality no longer holds if synaptic background activity is taken into account. By injecting stochastic conductances into guinea-pig thalamocortical neurons in slices, we show that the transfer function of these neurons is strongly influenced by conductance noise. The combination of synaptic noise with intrinsic properties gives a global responsiveness that is more linear, mixing single-spike and burst responses at all membrane potentials. Because in thalamic neurons, background synaptic input originates mainly from cortex, these results support a determinant role of corticothalamic feedback during sensory information processing.},

  abstract        = {Various types of neural-based signals, such as EEG, local field potentials and intracellular synaptic potentials, integrate multiple sources of activity distributed across large assemblies. They have in common a power-law frequency-scaling structure at high frequencies, but it is still unclear whether this scaling property is dominated by intrinsic neuronal properties or by network activity. The latter case is particularly interesting because if frequency-scaling reflects the network state it could be used to characterize the functional impact of the connectivity. In intracellularly recorded neurons of cat primary visual cortex in vivo, the power spectral density of V(m) activity displays a power-law structure at high frequencies with a fractional scaling exponent. We show that this exponent is not constant, but depends on the visual statistics used to drive the network. To investigate the determinants of this frequency-scaling, we considered a generic recurrent model of cortex receiving a retinotopically organized external input. Similarly to the in vivo case, our in computo simulations show that the scaling exponent reflects the correlation level imposed in the input. This systematic dependence was also replicated at the single cell level, by controlling independently, in a parametric way, the strength and the temporal decay of the pairwise correlation between presynaptic inputs. This last model was implemented in vitro by imposing the correlation control in artificial presynaptic spike trains through dynamic-clamp techniques. These in vitro manipulations induced a modulation of the scaling exponent, similar to that observed in vivo and predicted in computo. We conclude that the frequency-scaling exponent of the V(m) reflects stimulus-driven correlations in the cortical network activity. Therefore, we propose that the scaling exponent could be used to read-out the "effective" connectivity responsible for the dynamical signature of the population signals measured at different integration levels, from Vm to LFP, EEG and fMRI.},

We focus on how these electric properties shape the frequency scaling of brain signals at different scales, such as intracellular recordings, the local field potential (LFP), the electroencephalogram (EEG) or the magnetoencephalogram (MEG). These signals display frequency-scaling properties which are not consistent with resistive media. The medium appears to exert a frequency filtering scaling as 1/f, which is the typical frequency scaling of ionic diffusion. Such a scaling was also found recently by impedance measurements in physiological conditions. Ionic diffusion appears to be the only possible explanation to reconcile these measurements and the frequency-scaling properties found in different brain signals. However, other measurements suggest that the extracellular medium is essentially resistive. To resolve this discrepancy, we show new evidence that metal-electrode measurements can be perturbed by shunt currents going through the surface of the brain. Such a shunt may explain the contradictory measurements, and together with ionic diffusion, provides a framework where all observations can be reconciled. Finally, we propose a method to perform measurements avoiding shunting effects, thus enabling to test the predictions of this framework.},

Here we show in two evolutionarily distant vertebrates (Xenopus laevis cell culture and mouse nerve-muscle ex-vivo) that the skeletal muscle cell constantly senses, through two identified calcium signals, synaptic events and their efficacy in eliciting spikes. These sensors trigger retrograde signal(s) that control presynaptic neurotransmitter release, resulting in synaptic potentiation or depression. In the absence of spikes, synaptic events trigger potentiation. Once the synapse is sufficiently strong to initiate spiking, the occurrence of these spikes activates a negative retrograde feedback. These opposing signals dynamically balance the synapse in order to continuously adjust neurotransmitter release to a level matching current muscle cell excitability.},

  abstract        = {The role of interneurons in cortical microcircuits is strongly influenced by their passive and active electrical properties. Although different types of interneurons exhibit unique electrophysiological properties recorded at the soma, it is not yet clear whether these differences are also manifested in other neuronal compartments. To address this question, we have used voltage-sensitive dye to image the propagation of action potentials into the fine collaterals of axons and dendrites in two of the largest cortical interneuron subtypes in the mouse: fast-spiking interneurons, which are typically basket or chandelier neurons; and somatostatin containing interneurons, which are typically regular spiking Martinotti cells. We found that fast-spiking and somatostatin-expressing interneurons differed in their electrophysiological characteristics along their entire dendrosomatoaxonal extent. The action potentials generated in the somata and axons, including axon collaterals, of somatostatin-expressing interneurons are significantly broader than those generated in the same compartments of fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons. In addition, action potentials back-propagated into the dendrites of somatostatin-expressing interneurons much more readily than fast-spiking interneurons. Pharmacological investigations suggested that axonal action potential repolarization in both cell types depends critically upon Kv1 channels, whereas the axonal and somatic action potentials of somatostatin-expressing interneurons also depend on BK Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels. These results indicate that the two broad classes of interneurons studied here have expressly different subcellular physiological properties, allowing them to perform unique computational roles in cortical circuit operations. Neurons in the cerebral cortex are of two major types: excitatory and inhibitory. The proper balance of excitation and inhibition in the brain is critical for its operation. Neurons contain three main compartments: dendritic, somatic, and axonal. How the neurons receive information, process it, and pass on new information depends upon how these three compartments operate. While it has long been assumed that axons are simply for conducting information from the cell body to the synapses, here we demonstrate that the axons of different types of interneurons, the inhibitory cells, possess differing electrophysiological properties. This result implies that differing types of interneurons perform different tasks in the cortex, not only through their anatomical connections, but also through how their axons operate.},

We present here a new method that allows extracting estimates of the full time course of excitatory and inhibitory conductances from single-trial V(m) recordings. This method is based on oversampling of the V(m). We test the method numerically using models of increasing complexity. Finally, the method is evaluated using controlled conductance injection in cortical neurons in vitro using the dynamic-clamp technique. This conductance extraction method should be very useful for future in vivo applications.},

During sleep, their hyperpolarized membrane potential allows activation of the T-type calcium channels, promoting rhythmic high-frequency burst firing that reduces sensory information transfer. In contrast, in the waking state thalamic neurons mostly exhibit action potentials at low frequency (i.e., tonic firing), enabling the reliable transfer of incoming sensory inputs to cortex. Because of their nearly complete inactivation at the depolarized potentials that are experienced during the wake state, T-channels are not believed to modulate tonic action potential discharges. Here, we demonstrate using mice brain slices that activation of T-channels in thalamocortical neurons maintained in the depolarized/wake-like state is critical for the reliable expression of tonic firing, securing their excitability over changes in membrane potential that occur in the depolarized state. Our results establish a novel mechanism for the integration of sensory information by thalamocortical neurons and point to an unexpected role for T-channels in the early stage of information processing.},

  abstract        = {A wide diversity of models have been proposed to account for the spiking response of central neurons, from the integrate-and-fire (IF) model and its quadratic and exponential variants, to multiple-variable models such as the Izhikevich (IZ) model and the well-known Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) type models. Such models can capture different aspects of the spiking response of neurons, but there is few objective comparison of their performance. In this article, we provide such a comparison in the context of well-defined stimulation protocols, including, for each cell, DC stimulation, and a series of excitatory conductance injections, arising in the presence of synaptic background activity. We use the dynamic-clamp technique to characterize the response of regular-spiking neurons from guinea-pig visual cortex by computing families of post-stimulus time histograms (PSTH), for different stimulus intensities, and for two different background activities (low- and high-conductance states). The data obtained are then used to fit different classes of models such as the IF, IZ, or HH types, which are constrained by the whole data set. This analysis shows that HH models are generally more accurate to fit the series of experimental PSTH, but their performance is almost equaled by much simpler models, such as the exponential or pulse-based IF models. Similar conclusions were also reached by performing partial fitting of the data, and examining the ability of different models to predict responses that were not used for the fitting. Although such results must be qualified by using more sophisticated stimulation protocols, they suggest that nonlinear IF models can capture surprisingly well the response of cortical regular-spiking neurons and appear as useful candidates for network simulations with conductance-based synaptic interactions.},

Their firing pattern is close to a Poisson process, and their membrane potential (V(m)) is analogous to colored noise. One way to characterize this activity is to identify V(m) to a multidimensional stochastic process. We review here this approach and how it can be used to extract important statistical signatures of neuronal activity. The "VmD method" consists of fitting the V(m) distribution obtained intracellularly to analytic expressions derived from stochastic processes, and thereby deduce synaptic conductance parameters. However, this method requires at least two levels of V(m), which prevents applications to single-trial measurements. We also discuss methods that can be applied to single V(m) traces, such as power spectral analysis and the "STA method" to calculate spike-triggered average conductances based on a maximum likelihood procedure. A recently proposed method, the "VmT method", is based on the fusion of these two concepts. This method is analogous to the VmD method and estimates the mean excitatory and inhibitory conductances and their variances. However, it does so by using a maximum-likelihood estimation, and can thus be applied to single V(m) traces. All methods were tested using controlled conductance injection in dynamic-clamp experiments.},

Ideally such conductance time courses should be extracted from membrane potential (V(m)) activity, but this is difficult because the nonlinear contribution of conductances to the V(m) renders their estimation from the membrane equation extremely sensitive. We outline here a solution to this problem based on a discretization of the time axis. This procedure can extract the time course of excitatory and inhibitory conductances solely from the analysis of V(m) activity. We test this method by calculating spike-triggered averages of synaptic conductances using numerical simulations of the integrate-and-fire model subject to colored conductance noise. The procedure was also tested successfully in biological cortical neurons using conductance noise injected with dynamic clamp. This method should allow the extraction of synaptic conductances from V(m) recordings in vivo.},

Hybrid technology is applied in vitro to different paradigms such as: (1) simulating interactions between biological thalamocortical neurons, artificial reticular thalamic inhibitory interneurons and a simulated sensory input, (2) grafting an artificial sensory input to a wholly biological thalamic network that generates spontaneous sleep-like oscillations, (3) injecting in thalamocortical neurons a background synaptic bombardment mimicking the activity of corticothalamic inputs. We show that the graded control of the strength of intrathalamic inhibition, combined with the membrane polarization and the fluctuating synaptic noise in thalamocortical neurons, is able to govern functional shifts between different input/output transmission states of the thalamic gate.},

Intracellular recordings in layer 5 pyramidal cells in prefrontal and visual cortical slices maintained in vitro revealed spontaneous periods of synaptic bombardment. Testing the responsiveness of these cortical cells to synaptic inputs or the injection of artificial excitatory postsynaptic conductances of various amplitudes revealed that background synaptic activity dramatically increased the probability of response to small inputs, decreased the slope of the input-output curve, and decreased both the latency and jitter of action potential activation. Examining the effects of different components of synaptic barrages (namely, depolarization, increase in membrane conductance, and increase in membrane potential variance) revealed that the effects observed were dominated by the membrane depolarization and increase in variance. Depolarization increased the peak cross-correlation between injected complex in vivo-like waveforms through enhancement of responsiveness to small inputs, whereas increases in variance did so through a shift in firing mode from one of threshold detection to probabilistic discharge. These results indicate that rapid increases in neuronal responsiveness, as well as increases in spike timing precision, can be achieved through balanced barrages of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activity.},

This sustained activity is generated through recurrent excitation between pyramidal cells that is controlled by feedback inhibition and can have both a rapid onset and a rapid offset. The period of activity is associated with a marked increase in neuronal responsiveness to the intracellular injection of current pulses, especially those of smaller amplitude. Independently mimicking the depolarization, increase in membrane conductance and increase in noise associated with sustained activity revealed that the depolarization is largely responsible for the increase in neuronal responsiveness, although an increase in membrane noise also facilitates responses to small inputs. These results indicate that the persistent activity associated with the performance of working memory tasks may be generated largely through recurrent networks. They also suggest that feedback pathways, such as those involved in selective attention, may exert a powerful influence on neuronal responsiveness through synaptic bombardment.},

Such 'gating' involves inhibition of the thalamocortical relay neurons by the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We reconstructed the thalamocortical circuit as an artificial and biological hybrid network in vitro. With visual input simulated as retinal cell activity, we show here that when the gain in the thalamic inhibitory feedback loop is greater than a critical value, the circuit tends towards oscillations -- and thus imposes a temporal decorrelation of retinal cell input and thalamic relay output. This results in the functional disconnection of the cortex from the sensory drive, a feature typical of sleep states. Conversely, low gain in the feedback inhibition and the action of noradrenaline, a known modulator of arousal, converge to increase input output correlation in relay neurons. Combining gain control of feedback inhibition and modulation of membrane excitability thus enables thalamic circuits to finely tune the gating of spike transmission from sensory organs to the cortex.},

Paroxysmal activity developed within days and consisted of spike-wave complexes at 3-4 Hz occurring during the waking state (correlated with eye movements), being enhanced during slow-wave sleep (SWS) and blocked during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Prolonged hyperpolarizing events were seen not only during SWS (which is the case in normal animals) but also during both waking and REM, thus resulting in bimodal distribution of the membrane potential in all 3 natural states of vigilance. The increased synchrony of field potential activity expressed by shorter time of propagation over the cortical surface and the tendency toward generalization are ascribed to changes in intrinsic neuronal properties and potential disinhibition following cortical undercut.},

We begin with an overview of the electrophysiological properties of single neurons in different functional states, followed by a review of the phylogeny of the electrical properties of thalamic neurons, in several vertebrate species. The similarity in electrophysiological properties unambiguously indicates that the thalamocortical system must be as ancient as the vertebrate branch itself. We address the view that rather than simply relays, thalamic neurons have sui generis intrinsic electrical properties that govern their specific functional dynamics and regulate natural functional states such as sleep and vigilance. In addition, thalamocortical activity has been shown to be involved in the genesis of several neuropsychiatric conditions collectively described as thalamocortical dysrhythmia syndrome.},

  abstract        = {Cortical injury may lead to clinical seizures. We investigated the changing patterns of the sleeplike slow oscillation and its tendency to develop into paroxysmal activity consisting of spike-wave (SW) complexes at 2-4 Hz after partial deafferentation of the suprasylvian gyrus. Experiments were carried out in anesthetized cats, at different time intervals (wk 1 to wk 5, W1-W5) after cortical undercut. Multisite field potentials and single or dual intracellular recordings from the whole extent of the deafferented gyrus were used. The field components of the slow oscillation increased in amplitudes and were transformed into paroxysmal patterns, expressed by increased firing rates and tendency to neuronal bursting. The incidence of SW seizures was higher with transition from semiacute (W1) to chronic (W2-W5) stages after cortical undercut. The propagation delay of low-frequency activities decreased from W1 to W5, during both the slow oscillation and seizures. The initiation of seizures took place in territories contiguous to the relatively intact cortex (area 5 in the anterior part of the gyrus), as shown by cross-correlations of field potentials from different sites and simultaneous intracellular recordings from the anterior and posterior parts of the gyrus. The increased amplitudes of both slow oscillation and SW seizures, and their enhanced synchrony expressed by shorter time of propagation, are ascribed to increased neuronal and network excitability after cortical undercut.},

Here, we use a computational model of a neocortical circuit with extracellular potassium dynamics to show that activity-dependent modulation of intrinsic excitability can lead to sustained oscillations with slow transitions between two distinct firing modes: fast run (tonic spiking or fast bursts with few spikes) and slow bursting. These transitions are caused by a bistability with hysteresis in a pyramidal cell model. Balanced excitation and inhibition stabilizes a network of pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons in the bistable region and causes sustained periodic alternations between distinct oscillatory states. During spike-wave seizures, neocortical paroxysmal activity exhibits qualitatively similar slow transitions between fast run and bursting. We therefore predict that extracellular potassium dynamics can cause alternating episodes of fast and slow oscillatory states in both normal and epileptic neocortical networks.},

Correlations of hippocampal atrophy and focal low-frequency magnetic activity in Alzheimer disease: volumetric MR imaging-magnetoencephalographic study. Am J Neuroradiol. 2003 24(3):481-487]. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that such a relationship does exist not only in AD patients but also across the continuum of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Resting, eyes-closed EEG data were recorded in 34 MCI and 65 AD subjects. EEG rhythms of interest were delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta 1 (13-20 Hz), and beta 2 (20-30 Hz). EEG cortical sources were estimated by LORETA. Cortical EEG sources were correlated with MR-based measurements of lobar brain volume (white and gray matter). A negative correlation was observed between the frontal white matter and the amplitude of frontal delta sources (2-4 Hz) across MCI and AD subjects. These results confirmed for the first time the hypothesis that the sources of resting delta rhythms (2-4 Hz) are correlated with lobar brain volume across MCI and AD subjects. The present findings support, at least at group level, the 'transition hypothesis' of brain structural and functional continuity between MCI and AD.},

The mechanisms operating in this model of post-traumatic epileptogenesis are not well understood. We hypothesized that the spontaneous burst discharges recorded in chronically isolated neocortex result from homeostatic plasticity (a mechanism generally assumed to stabilize neuronal activity) induced by low neuronal activity after deafferentation. To test this hypothesis we constructed computer models of neocortex incorporating a biologically based homeostatic plasticity rule that operates to maintain firing rates. After deafferentation, homeostatic upregulation of excitatory synapses on pyramidal cells, either with or without concurrent downregulation of inhibitory synapses or upregulation of intrinsic excitability, initiated slowly repeating burst discharges that closely resembled the epileptiform burst discharges recorded in chronically isolated neocortex. These burst discharges lasted a few hundred ms, propagated at 1-3 cm/s and consisted of large (10-15 mV) intracellular depolarizations topped by a small number of action potentials. Our results support a role for homeostatic synaptic plasticity as a novel mechanism of post-traumatic epileptogenesis.},

The original hypothesis that RE neurons are pacemakers of spindles, based on absence of this oscillation in thalamocortical (TC) systems after disconnection from RE nucleus and presence of spindle rhythmicity in the deafferented RE nucleus, is supported by new experimental results in vivo, in vitro and in computo showing that interactions through chemical synapses as well as electrical coupling among inhibitory RE neurons lead to generation and synchronization of spindle sequences within the nucleus. Besides their pacemaking role in spindle generation, RE neurons are crucially implicated in the inhibition of TC neurons during cortically generated spike-wave (absence) seizures, which may explain the obliteration of signals from the external world and unconsciousness during these epileptic fits.},

This article focuses on two topics: (i) the role of thalamic reticular neurons in the initiation of spindles, a hallmark oscillation during early sleep stages; and (ii) the reticular-induced inhibition of thalamocortical neurons during cortically generated spike-wave seizures. Although hotly debated during the past decade, the idea of spindle generation by a network of GABAergic reticular neurons was recently supported by in vivo and in computo studies demonstrating interactions between inhibitory reticular neurons that lead to spindle sequences. During spike-wave seizures and electrical paroxysms of the Lennox-Gastaut type, which arise in the neocortex, reticular neurons are powerfully excited through corticofugal projections and they produce prolonged inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in thalamocortical neurons. Thus, GABAergic reticular neurons are crucial in the generation of some sleep rhythms, which produce synaptic plasticity, and in inhibiting external signals through thalamocortical neurons, which leads to unconsciousness during absence epilepsy.},

Here we investigated spontaneously occurring seizures consisting of spike-wave complexes intermingled with fast runs in ketamine-xylazine anesthetized cats, using dual intracellular recordings in which one pipette contained a control solution and another pipette contained blockers of K(+), Na(+), or Ca(2+) currents. We show that closely located neocortical neurons display virtually identical fluctuations of the membrane potential during electrographic seizures, thus directly demonstrating a high degree of focal synchrony during paroxysmal activity. In addition to synaptic drives, the persistent Na(+) current [I(Na(p))] and probably the high-threshold Ca(2+) current contributed to the generation of paroxysmal depolarizing shifts (PDSs) during cortically driven seizures. Ca(2+)-activated K(+) current [I(K(Ca))] took also part in the control of the amplitude and duration of PDSs. The hyperpolarizing components of seizures largely depended on Cs(+)-sensitive K(+) currents. I(K(Ca)) played a significant, while not exclusive, role in the mediation of hyperpolarizing potentials related to EEG "waves" during spike-wave seizures. We conclude that intrinsic cellular factors have significant role in the generation of depolarizing and hyperpolarizing components of seizures.},

  abstract        = {The thalamic reticular (RE) nucleus is a major source of inhibition in the thalamus. It plays a crucial role in regulating the excitability of thalamocortical networks and in generating some sleep rhythms. Current-clamp intracellular recordings of RE neurons in cats under barbiturate anesthesia revealed the presence of membrane bistability in approximately 20% of neurons. Bistability consisted of two alternate membrane potentials, separated by approximately 17-20 mV. While non-bistable (common) RE neurons fired rhythmic spike-bursts during spindles, bistable RE neurons fired tonically, with burst modulation, throughout spindle sequences. Bistability was strongly voltage dependent and only expressed under resting conditions (i.e. no current injection). The transition from the silent to the active state was a regenerative event that could be activated by brief depolarization, whereas brief hyperpolarizations could switch the membrane potential from the active to the silent state. These effects outlasted the current pulses. Corticothalamic stimulation could also switch the membrane potential from silent to active states. Addition of QX-314 in the recording micropipette either abolished or disrupted membrane bistability, suggesting I(Na(p)) to be responsible for its generation. Thalamocortical cells presented various patterns of spindling that reflected the membrane bistability in RE neurons. Finally, experimental data and computer simulations predicted a role for RE neurons' membrane bistability in inducing various patterns of spindling in target thalamocortical cells. We conclude that membrane bistability of RE neurons is an intrinsic property, likely generated by I(Na(p)) and modulated by cortical influences, as well as a factor that determines different patterns of spindle rhythms in thalamocortical neurons.},

  abstract        = {Thalamic reticular (RE) neurons are crucially implicated in brain rhythms. Here, we report that RE neurons of adult cats, recorded and stained intracellularly in vivo, displayed spontaneously occurring spikelets, which are characteristic of central neurons that are coupled electrotonically via gap junctions. Spikelets occurred spontaneously during spindles, an oscillation in which RE neurons play a leading role, as well as during interspindle lulls. They were significantly different from excitatory postsynaptic potentials and also distinct from fast prepotentials that are presumably dendritic spikes generated synaptically. Spikelets were strongly reduced by halothane, a blocker of gap junctions. Multi-site extracellular recordings performed before, during and after administration of halothane demonstrated a role for electrical coupling in the synchronization of spindling activity within the RE nucleus. Finally, computational models of RE neurons predicted that gap junctions between these neurons could mediate the spread of low-frequency activity at great distances. These experimental and modeling data suggest that electrotonic coupling within the RE nucleus plays an important role in the generation and synchronization of low-frequency (spindling) activities in the thalamus.},

We investigated the changes in callosally elicited excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) of neurons from cortical association areas 5 and 7 of cats under barbiturate or ketamine-xylazine anesthesia. Single pulses to callosal pathway evoked control EPSPs; pulse-trains were subsequently applied at different frequencies to homotopic sites in the contralateral cortex, as conditioning stimulation; thereafter, the single pulses were applied again to test changes in synaptic responsiveness by comparing the amplitudes of control and conditioned EPSPs. In 41 of 42 neurons recorded under barbiturate anesthesia, all frequencies of conditioning callosal stimuli induced short-term (5-30 min) enhancement of test EPSPs elicited by single stimuli. Neurons tested with successive conditioning pulse-trains at different frequencies displayed stronger enhancement with high-frequency (40-100 Hz) than with low-frequency (10-20 Hz) rhythmic pulse-trains; >100 Hz, the potentiation saturated. In a neuronal sample, microdialysis of an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker in barbiturate-treated cats suppressed this potentiation, and potentiation of callosally evoked EPSPs was not detected in neurons recorded under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia, thus indicating that EPSPs' potentiation implicates, at least partially, NMDA receptors. These data suggest that callosal activities occurring within low-frequency and fast-frequency oscillations play a role in cortical synaptic plasticity.},

Given the supremacy of cortical inputs, we analysed here the characteristics and possible mechanisms underlying a secondary component of the cortically elicited depolarization in RE neurons, recorded in cats under barbiturate anesthesia. Electrical stimulation of corticothalamic axons in the internal capsule evoked fixed and short-latency excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) that, by increasing stimulation intensity and at hyperpolarized levels (< -70 mV), developed into low-threshold spikes and spindle oscillations. The threshold for spindle oscillations was 60% higher than that required for evoking minimal EPSPs. The evoked EPSPs included a secondary depolarizing component, which appeared approximately 5 ms after the peak of the initial component and was voltage dependent, i.e. most prominent between -70 mV and -85 mV, while being greatly reduced or absent at more hyperpolarized levels. The secondary depolarizing component was sensitive to QX-314 in the recording micropipette. We suggest that the secondary component of cortically evoked EPSPs in RE neurons is due to the dendritic activation of T-currents, with a probable contribution of the persistent Na+ current. This late component affected the integrative properties of RE neurons, including their spiking output and temporal summation of incoming cortical inputs.},

PPS of homosynaptic cortico-cortical pathways produced facilitation, depression, or no significant effects in cortical pathways, whereas cortical responses to thalamocortical inputs were mostly facilitated at both short and long intervals. By contrast, heterosynaptic interactions between either cortical and thalamic, or thalamic and cortical, inputs generally produced decreases in the peak amplitudes and depolarization area of evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), with maximal effect at approximately 10 ms and lasting from 60 to 100 ms. All neurons tested with thalamic followed by cortical stimuli showed a decrease in the apparent input resistance (R(in)), the time course of which paralleled that of decreased responses, suggesting that shunting is the factor accounting for EPSP's decrease. Only half of neurons tested with cortical followed by thalamic stimuli displayed changes in R(in). Spike shunting in the thalamus may account for those cases in which decreased synaptic responsiveness of cortical neurons was not associated with decreased R(in) because thalamocortical neurons showed decreased firing probability during cortical stimulation. These results suggest a short-lasting but strong shunting between thalamocortical and cortical inputs onto cortical neurons.},

  abstract        = {The thalamic reticular (RE) nucleus is a key structure in the generation of spindles, a hallmark bioelectrical oscillation during early stages of sleep. Intracellular recordings of RE neurons in vivo revealed the presence of prolonged hyperpolarizing potentials preceding spindles in a subgroup (30%) of neurons. These hyperpolarizations (6-10 mV) lasted for 200-300 ms and were present just before the onset of spontaneously occurring spindle waves. Corticothalamic volleys also were effective in generating such hyperpolarizations followed by spindles in RE neurons. A drop of up to 40% in the apparent input resistance (R(in)) was associated with these hyperpolarizing potentials, suggesting an active process rather than disfacilitation. Accordingly, the reversal potential was approximately -100 mV for both spontaneous and cortically elicited hyperpolarizations, consistent with the activation of slow K(+) conductances. QX-314 in the recording pipettes decreased both the amplitude and incidence of prolonged hyperpolarizations, suggesting the participation of G protein-dependent K(+) currents in the generation of hyperpolarizations. Simultaneous extracellular and intracellular recordings in the RE nucleus demonstrated that some RE neurons discharged during the hyperpolarizations and, thus, may be implicated in their generation. The prolonged hyperpolarizations preceding spindles may play a role in the transition from tonic to bursting firing of RE neurons within a range of membrane potential (-60 to -65 mV) at which they set favorable conditions for the generation of low-threshold spike bursts that initiate spindle sequences. These data are further arguments for the generation of spindles within the thalamic RE nucleus.},

Current views of trauma-induced epileptogenesis suggest that chronic neuronal hyperexcitability and extensive morphological reorganization of the traumatized cortex are required for the generation of electrographic seizures. However, the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of electrographic seizures shortly after cortical injury are poorly understood. Here we show that, in the experimental model of partially deafferented (undercut) cortex, an increase in intrinsic and synaptic excitability of neurons in areas adjacent to the undercut cortex is sufficient for the generation of electrographic paroxysmal activity within few hours after partial cortical deafferentation. Locally increased and spatially restricted neuronal excitability arose from the increased incidence of intrinsically bursting neurons, enhanced intrinsic and synaptic neuronal responsiveness, and slight disinhibition. These mechanisms only operate in neurons located in the vicinity of partially deafferented sites because, after the cortical injury, partially deafferented neurons are mostly silent and hypoexcitable. Our results suggest that trauma-induced electrographic seizures first arise in cortical fields that are closest to the site of injury and such seizures do not require long-term neuronal reorganization.},

  abstract        = {The two processes of activation in thalamocortical systems exerted by mesopontine cholinergic neurons are (a) a direct depolarization associated with increased input resistance of thalamic relay neurons, which is antagonized by muscarinic blockers, and (b) a disinhibition of the same neurons via hyperpolarization of inhibitory thalamic reticular neurons. Low-frequency (< 15 Hz) oscillations during slow-wave sleep, characterized by rhythmic and prolonged hyperpolarizations, are suppressed by brainstem cholinergic neurons and nucleus basalis cholinergic and GABAergic neurons projecting to thalamic reticular neurons. Fast rhythms (20-60 Hz) appear during the sustained depolarization of thalamic and neocortical neurons during brain-active states that are accompanied by increased release of acetylcholine (ACh) in the thalamus and cerebral cortex. Such fast rhythms also occur during the depolarizing phases of the slow oscillation (0.5-1 Hz) in non-REM sleep. Intracellular recordings of neocortical neurons during natural states of waking and sleep demonstrate stable and increased input resistance of corticocortical and corticothalamic neurons during the sustained depolarization in wakefulness, compared to the depolarizing phase of the slow oscillation in non-REM sleep. Despite the highly increased synaptic inputs along different afferent systems that open many conductances of cortical neurons during wakefulness, the increased input resistance is attributed to the effect of acetylcholine on cortical neurons.},

In vivo experiments with partial deafferentation of cat suprasylvian gyrus after extensive undercut of the white matter were conducted using multi-site EEG, extracellular unit and intracellular recordings. The amplitudes of EEG waves were much higher in the areas surrounding deafferented cortical fields as compared with control and with undercut cortex. In 40% of animals with undercut cortex, paroxysmal activity occurred 2-3 h after the undercut and was initiated in the relatively intact cortex, adjacent to the more disconnected one. The seizures that followed the undercut consisted of spike-wave/polyspike-wave complexes and fast runs, resembling the electrographic patterns of some clinical epileptic syndromes. An increased local synchrony in the relatively intact cortex evolved into paroxysmal activity that ultimately spread to the deafferented cortex. The electrographic seizures were found only in animals that showed a propagation of the slow sleep-like oscillation in control conditions. The increase of long-range synchrony within a given seizure was associated with seizure termination. These results indicate that alterations in neuronal synchrony following neuronal trauma can be a critical factor triggering electrographic seizures.},

Intracellular recordings from thalamic and related cortical neurons in vivo demonstrate that, during natural slow-wave sleep oscillations or their experimental models, both thalamic and cortical neurons progressively enhance their responsiveness. This potentiation lasts for several minutes after the end of oscillatory periods. Cortical neurons display self-sustained activity, similar to responses evoked during previous epochs of stimulation, despite the fact that thalamic neurons remain under a powerful hyperpolarizing pressure. These data suggest that, far from being a quiescent state during which the cortex and subcortical structures are globally inhibited, slow-wave sleep may consolidate memory traces acquired during wakefulness in corticothalamic networks. Similar phenomena occur as a consequence of fast oscillations during brain-activated states.},

There are three major oscillations during NREM sleep. Spindles are generated within the thalamus, due to thalamic reticular (RE) neurons that impose rhythmic inhibitory sequences onto TC neurons, but the widespread synchronization of this rhythm is governed by corticothalamic projections. There are two types of delta activity: clock-like waves generated in TC neurons by the interplay between two hyperpolarization-activated inward currents; and cortical waves that survive extensive thalamectomy. The hallmark of NREM sleep activity is the slow oscillation, generated intracortically, which has the virtue of grouping the other types of sleep activities, thus leading to a coalescence of different rhythms that can only be observed in intact-brain animals and humans. Far from being epiphenomena, with no functional role, NREM sleep oscillations, particularly spindles and their experimental model augmenting responses, produce synaptic plasticity in target cortical neurons and resonant activity in corticothalamic loops, as in "memory" processes. Upon brain arousal, spindles are blocked by inhibition of RE neurons, the spindles' pacemakers; clock-like delta rhythm is obliterated by depolarization of TC neurons; and the cortically generated slow oscillation is abolished by selective erasure of its hyperpolarizing components. Fast (beta and gamma) oscillations are roduced by the depolarizing effects of mesopontine cholinergic neurons acting on TC neurons and nucleus basalis neurons acting on cortical neurons.},

Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), and/or antidromic responses were elicited by stimulating homotopic sites in the contralateral cortical areas. Differential features of EPSPs related to latencies, amplitudes, and slopes were detected in closely located (50 microm or less) neurons recorded in succession along the same electrode track. In contrast to synchronous thalamocortical volleys that excited most neurons within a cortical column, stimuli applied to homotopic sites in the contralateral cortex activated neurons at restricted cortical depths. Median latencies of callosally evoked EPSPs were 1.5 to 4 ms in various cortical cell-classes. Fast-rhythmic-bursting neurons displayed EPSPs whose amplitudes were threefold larger, and latencies two- or threefold shorter, than those found in the three other cellular classes. Converging callosal and thalamic inputs were recorded in the same cortical neuron. EPSPs or IPSPs were elicited by stimulating foci spaced by <1 mm in the contralateral cortex. In the overwhelming majority of neurons, latencies of antidromic responses were between 1.2 and 3.1 ms; however, some callosal neurons had much longer latencies, <or=18.5 ms. Some neurons were excited monosynaptically through the callosal pathway and identified antidromically from appropriate thalamic nuclei, thus revealing a callosal-corticothalamic pathway. Data are discussed in relation to the commissural spread of fast and slow normal oscillations as well as paroxysmal activities.},

The animals displayed spontaneously occurring and electrically induced seizures comprising spike-wave complexes (2-3 Hz) and fast runs (10-20 Hz). Neocortical ripples had much higher amplitudes during seizures than during the slow oscillation preceding the onset of seizures. A series of experimental data from the present study supports the hypothesis that ripples are implicated in seizure initiation. Ripples were particularly strong at the onset of seizures and halothane, which antagonizes the occurrence of ripples, also blocked seizures. The firing of electrophysiologically defined cellular types was phase-locked with ripples in simultaneously recorded field potentials. This indicates that ripples during paroxysmal events are associated with a coordination of firing in a majority of neocortical neurons. This was confirmed with dual intracellular recordings. Based on the amplitude that neocortical ripples reach during paroxysmal events, we propose a mechanism by which neocortical ripples during normal network activity could actively participate in the initiation of seizures on reaching a certain threshold amplitude. This mechanism involves a vicious feedback loop in which very fast oscillations in field potentials are a reflection of synchronous action potentials, and in turn these oscillations help generate and synchronize action potentials in adjacent neurons through electrical interactions.},

In isolated cortical slabs (10 mm long, 6 mm wide and 4-5 mm deep), augmenting responses to pulse-trains at 10 Hz (responses with growing amplitudes from the second stimulus in a train) were elicited only by relatively high-intensity stimuli. At low intensities, responses were decremental. The largest augmenting responses were evoked in neurones located close to the stimulation site. Quantitative analyses of the number of action potentials and the amplitude and area of depolarization during augmenting responses in a population of neurones recorded from slabs showed that the most dramatic increases in the number of spikes with successive stimuli, and the greatest increase in depolarization amplitude, were found in conventional fast-spiking (FS) neurones. The largest increase in the area of depolarization was found in regular-spiking (RS) neurones. Dual intracellular recordings from a pair of FS and RS neurones in the slab revealed more action potentials in the FS neurone during augmenting responses and a significant increase in the depolarization area of the RS neurone that was dependent on the firing of the FS neurone. Self-sustained seizures could occur in the slab after rhythmic stimuli at 10 Hz. In the intact cortex, repeated sequences of stimuli generating augmenting responses or spontaneous spindles could induce an increased synaptic responsiveness to single stimuli, which lasted for several minutes. A similar time course of increased responsiveness was obtained with induction of cellular plasticity. These data suggest that augmenting responses elicited by stimulation, as well as spontaneously occurring spindles, may induce short- and medium-term plasticity of neuronal responses.},

Both the Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) currents (I(K(Ca))) and disfacilitation play critical roles in the generation of hyperpolarizing potentials. In vivo experiments and computational models are used here to investigate whether the hyperpolarization-activated depolarizing current (I(h)) in cortical neurons also contributes to the generation of paroxysmal onsets. Hyperpolarizing current pulses revealed a depolarizing sag in approximately 20% of cortical neurons. Intracellular recordings from glial cells indirectly indicated an increase in extracellular potassium concentration ([K(+)](o)) during paroxysmal activities, leading to a positive shift in the reversal potential of K(+)-mediated currents, including I(h). In the paroxysmal neocortex, approximately 20% of neurons show repolarizing potentials originating from hyperpolarizations associated with depth-electroencephalogram positive waves of spike-wave complexes. The onset of these repolarizing potentials corresponds to maximal [K(+)](o) as estimated from dual simultaneous impalements from neurons and glial cells. Computational models showed how, after the increased [K(+)](o), the interplay between I(h), I(K(Ca)), and a persistent Na(+) current, I(Na(P)), could organize paroxysmal oscillations at a frequency of 2-3 Hz.},

Oscillations (<1 Hz) in SWS and transformation to an activated awake state were investigated with intracellular recordings in vivo and with computational models of the corticothalamic system. Occasional summation of the miniature EPSPs during the hyperpolarized (silent) phase of SWS oscillation activated the persistent sodium current and depolarized the membrane of cortical pyramidal (PY) cells sufficiently for spike generation. In the model, this triggered the active phase, which was maintained by lateral PY-PY excitation and persistent sodium current. Progressive depression of the excitatory interconnections and activation of Ca2+-dependent K+ current led to termination of the 20-25 Hz activity after 500-1000 msec. Including thalamocortical (TC) and thalamic reticular neurons in the model increased the duration of the active epochs up to 1-1.5 sec and introduced waning spindle sequences. An increase in acetylcholine activity, which is associated with activated states, was modeled by the reduction in the K+ leak current in PY and TC cells and by a decrease in intracortical PY-PY synaptic conductances. These changes eliminated the hyperpolarizing phases of network activity and transformed cortical neurons to tonic firing at 15-20 Hz. During the transition from SWS to the activated state, the input resistance of cortical neurons gradually increased and, in a fully activated state, reached the same or even higher values as during silent phases of SWS oscillations. The model describes many essential features of SWS and activated states in the thalamocortical system as well as the transition between them.},

  abstract        = {This paper summarizes the present knowledge about the cellular bases of the sleep K-complex (KC). The KC has two phases: the initial surface-positive wave is due to the synchronous excitation of cortical neurones, while the subsequent surface-negative wave represents neuronal hyperpolarization. These variations of membrane potential occur within a slow (<1 Hz) oscillation that characterizes all sleep stages. Therefore, KCs are periodic, and their shape and frequency are modulated by the increasing degree of deafferentation attained by the corticothalamic network with the deepening of the sleep. Within this network, the rhythmic KCs recurring at the frequency of the slow oscillation play a leading role by triggering and grouping other sleep oscillations, such as spindles (7-14 Hz) and delta (1-4 Hz). The KC is mainly a spontaneous event generated in cortical networks. During nocturnal epileptic seizures, the KCs are precursors of paroxysmal spike-wave complexes.},

Augmenting responses can also be evoked in cortical slices and isolated cortical slabs in vivo. Here we show that a realistic network model of cortical pyramidal cells and interneurones including short-term plasticity of inhibitory and excitatory synapses replicates the main features of augmenting responses as obtained in isolated slabs in vivo. Repetitive stimulation of synaptic inputs at frequencies around 10 Hz produced postsynaptic potentials that grew in size and carried an increasing number of action potentials resulting from the depression of inhibitory synaptic currents. Frequency selectivity was obtained through the relatively weak depression of inhibitory synapses at low frequencies, and strong depression of excitatory synapses together with activation of a calcium-activated potassium current at high frequencies. This network resonance is a consequence of short-term synaptic plasticity in a network of neurones without intrinsic resonances. These results suggest that short-term plasticity of cortical synapses could shape the dynamics of synchronized oscillations in the brain.},

Here, we study computational models of neurons to investigate the functional effects of dendritic spikes. In agreement with previous studies, we found that point neurons or neurons with passive dendrites increase their somatic firing rate in response to the correlation of synaptic bombardment for a wide range of input conditions, i.e. input firing rates, synaptic conductances, or refractory periods. However, neurons with active dendrites show the opposite behavior: for a wide range of conditions the firing rate decreases as a function of correlation. We found this property in three types of models of dendritic excitability: a Hodgkin-Huxley model of dendritic spikes, a model with integrate and fire dendrites, and a discrete-state dendritic model. We conclude that fast dendritic spikes confer much broader computational properties to neurons, sometimes opposite to that of point neurons.},

Taking advantage of the separation of excitatory and inhibitory neuron types, we construct a model including this distinction. This approach allows us to shed light on differences between excitatory and inhibitory activity across different brain states such as wakefulness and deep sleep, in agreement with previous findings. Additionally, maximum entropy models can also unveil novel features of neuronal interactions, which are found to be dominated by pairwise interactions during wakefulness, but are population-wide during deep sleep. Overall, we demonstrate that maximum entropy models can be useful to analyze datasets with classified neuron types and to reveal the respective roles of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in organizing coherent dynamics in the cerebral cortex.},

APs are usually initiated in the short segment of the axon called the axon initial segment (AIS). It was recently proposed that at the onset of an AP the soma and the AIS form a dipole. We study the extracellular signature [the extracellular AP (EAP)] generated by such a dipole. First, we demonstrate the formation of the dipole and its extracellular signature in detailed morphological models of a reconstructed pyramidal neuron. Then, we study the EAP waveform and its spatial dependence in models with axonal AP initiation and contrast it with the EAP obtained in models with somatic AP initiation. We show that in the models with axonal AP initiation the dipole forms between somatodendritic compartments and the AIS, and not between soma and dendrites as in the classical models. The soma-dendrites dipole is present only in models with somatic AP initiation. Our study has consequences for interpreting extracellular recordings of single-neuron activity and determining electrophysiological neuron types, but also for better understanding the origins of the high-frequency macroscopic extracellular potentials recorded in the brain.},

CpG 7909 injections were administered intramuscularly to rats or rabbits 28 and 14days before pairing, on 4 or 5 occasions during gestation, and on lactation day 7. The No Observed Adverse Effect Level for female fertility, embryo-fetal and pre- and post-natal development was 4.2mg/kg in both species, approximately 500-fold higher than the anticipated human dose. In conclusion, the anticipated risk to humans is considered low for sporadic intramuscular exposure to CpG 7909.},

  abstract        = {Neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) respond to peripheral stimulation with synchronized bursts of spikes, which lock to the macroscopic 600-Hz EEG waves. The mechanism of burst generation and synchronization in S1 is not yet understood. Using models of single-neuron responses fitted to unit recordings from macaque monkeys, we show that these synchronized bursts are the consequence of correlated synaptic inputs combined with a refractory mechanism. In the presence of noise these models reproduce also the observed trial-to-trial response variability, where individual bursts represent one of many stereotypical temporal spike patterns. When additional slower and global excitability fluctuations are introduced the single-neuron spike patterns are correlated with the population activity, as demonstrated in experimental data. The underlying biophysical mechanism of S1 responses involves thalamic inputs arriving through depressing synapses to cortical neurons in a high-conductance state. Our findings show that a simple feedforward processing of peripheral inputs could give rise to neuronal responses with nontrivial temporal and population statistics. We conclude that neural systems could use refractoriness to encode variable cortical states into stereotypical short-term spike patterns amenable to processing at neuronal time scales (tens of milliseconds).},

  abstract     = {Voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) is a key neurophysiological recording tool because it reaches brain scales that remain inaccessible to other techniques. The development of this technique from   to the behaving nonhuman primate has only been made possible thanks to the long-lasting, visionary work of Amiram Grinvald. This work has opened new scientific perspectives to the great benefit to the neuroscience community. However, this unprecedented technique remains largely under-utilized, and many future possibilities await for VSDI to reveal new functional operations. One reason why this tool has not been used extensively is the inherent complexity of the signal. For instance, the signal reflects mainly the subthreshold neuronal population response and is not linked to spiking activity in a straightforward manner. Second, VSDI gives access to intracortical recurrent dynamics that are intrinsically complex and therefore nontrivial to process. Computational approaches are thus necessary to promote our understanding and optimal use of this powerful technique. Here, we review such approaches, from computational models to dissect the mechanisms and origin of the recorded signal, to advanced signal processing methods to unravel new neuronal interactions at mesoscopic scale. Only a stronger development of interdisciplinary approaches can bridge micro- to macroscales.},

The vaccine is composed of recombinant varicella zoster virus glycoprotein E (gE), and liposome-based Adjuvant System AS01. To evaluate the potential local and systemic effects of this vaccine, three studies were performed in rabbits. In the first two studies, rabbits received a single intramuscular (IM; study 1) or subcutaneous (SC; study 2) dose of gE/AS01, AS01 alone (in study 2 only) or saline, and the local tolerance was evaluated up to 3 days after administration. Under these conditions, only local inflammatory reactions at the injection sites were detected by microscopic evaluation. In the third study, gE/AS01, AS01 alone or saline, were injected SC or IM on four occasions at 2 week intervals. General health status, local tolerance, ophthalmology, haematology and blood chemistry parameters were monitored. Macroscopic and microscopic evaluations were performed after termination of the study. The only treatment-related changes included a transient increase in neutrophils, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen levels and microscopic signs of inflammation at the injection sites, which are expected observations related to the elicited inflammatory reaction. The SC and IM routes of administration produced similar systemic effects. However, microscopic findings at the injection sites differed. One month after the last injection, recovery was complete in all groups. In conclusion, the single and repeated SC and IM administration of the gE/AS01 vaccine were locally and systemically well-tolerated in rabbits and support the clinical development of the vaccine.

We show here that such features naturally emerge from networks in self-sustained irregular regimes away from criticality. In these regimes, statistical physics theory of large interacting systems predict a regime where the nodes have independent and identically distributed dynamics. We thus investigated the statistics of a system in which units are replaced by independent stochastic surrogates and found the same power-law statistics, indicating that these are not sufficient to establish criticality. We rather suggest that these are universal features of large-scale networks when considered macroscopically. These results put caution on the interpretation of scaling laws found in nature.},

We investigated the potential effects of administration of the AS03-adjuvanted vaccine, non-adjuvanted vaccine antigen and AS03 Adjuvant System alone, on the central nervous system (CNS) in one-month-old cotton rats. Naïve or A(H1N1)pdm09 virus-primed animals received 2 or 3 intramuscular injections, respectively, of test article or saline at 2-week intervals. Parameters related to systemic inflammation (hematology, serum IL-6/IFN-γ/TNF-α) were assessed. Potential effects on the CNS were investigated by histopathological evaluation of brain sections stained with hematoxylin-and-eosin, or by immunohistochemical staining of microglia, using Iba1 and CD68 as markers for microglia identification/activation, albumin as indicator of vascular leakage, and hypocretin. We also determined cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin levels and hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody titers. Immunogenicity of the AS03-adjuvanted A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic influenza vaccine was confirmed by the induction of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies. Both AS03-adjuvanted vaccine and AS03 alone activated transient innate (neutrophils/eosinophils) immune responses. No serum cytokines were detected. CNS analyses revealed neither microglia activation nor inflammatory cellular infiltrates in the brain. No differences between treatment groups were detected for albumin extravascular leakage, CSF hypocretin levels, numbers of hypocretin-positive neuronal bodies or distributions of hypocretin-positive axonal/dendritic projections. Consequently, there was no evidence that intramuscular administration of the test articles promoted inflammation or damage in the CNS, or blood-brain barrier disruption, in this model.},

The vaccine contains recombinant virus-like particles assembled from the L1 major capsid proteins of the cervical cancer-causing viral types HPV-16 and HPV-18, and Adjuvant System 04 (AS04), which contains the immunostimulant MPL and aluminium salt. To evaluate potential local and systemic toxic effects of the HPV-16/18 vaccine or AS04 alone, three repeated-dose studies were performed in rabbits and rats. One rabbit study also included a single-dose evaluation. In rabbits (~2.5 kg), the full human dose (HD) of the vaccine was evaluated (0.5 ml per injection site), and in rats (~250 g), 1/5 HD of vaccine was evaluated, corresponding to ≥ 12 times the dosage in humans relative to body weight. In both animal models, the treatment-related changes included a slight transient increase in the number of circulating neutrophils as well as a local inflammatory reaction at the injection site. These treatment-related changes were less pronounced after four doses of AS04 alone than after four doses of the HPV-16/18 vaccine. Additional treatment-related changes in the rat included lower albumin/globulin ratios and microscopic signs of inflammation in the popliteal lymph nodes. In both animal models, 13 weeks after the fourth dose, recovery was nearly complete, although at the injection site in some animals there were signs of discoloration, muscle-fibre regeneration and focal points of macrophage infiltration. Therefore, in these non-clinical models, the single and repeated dose administrations of the HPV-16/18 vaccine or AS04 alone were safe and well tolerated.},

AS03 is an oil-in-water emulsion containing α-tocopherol, squalene and polysorbate 80. To support the clinical development of AS03-adjuvanted pandemic-influenza vaccines, the local and systemic toxicity of test articles containing split-influenza A(H5N1) and/or AS03 were evaluated after 3-4 intramuscular (i.m.) injections in rabbits. Treatment-related effects were restricted to mild inflammatory responses and were induced primarily by the test articles containing AS03. The injection-site inflammation was mild at 3 days, and minimal at 4 weeks after the last injection; and was reflected by signs of activation in the draining lymph nodes and by systemic effects in the blood including a transient increase of neutrophils. In addition, a study in mice explored the biodistribution of A(H5N1) vaccines or AS03 through radiolabelling the antigen or constituents of AS03 prior to injection. In this evaluation, 57-73% of AS03's principal constituents had cleared from the injection site 3 days after injection, and their different clearance kinetics were suggestive of AS03's dissociation. All these AS03 constituents entered into the draining lymph nodes within 30 min after injection. In conclusion, the administration of repeated doses of the H5N1/AS03 vaccine was well tolerated in the rabbit, and was primarily associated with transient mild inflammation at the injection site and draining lymph nodes. The biodistribution kinetics of AS03 constituents in the mouse were consistent with AS03 inducing this pattern of inflammation.},

  abstract        = {The MAGE-A3 recombinant protein combined with AS15 immunostimulant (MAGE-A3 Cancer Immunotherapeutic) is under development by GlaxoSmithKline for the treatment of lung cancer and melanoma. We performed non-clinical safety studies evaluating potential local and systemic toxic effects induced by MAGE-A3 Cancer Immunotherapeutic in rabbits (study 1) and cynomolgus monkeys (study 2). Animals were allocated to two groups to receive a single (rabbits) or 25 repeated (every 2 weeks) injections (monkeys) of MAGE-A3 Cancer Immunotherapeutic (treatment groups) or saline (control groups). All rabbits were sacrificed 3 days post-injection and monkeys 3 days following last injection (3/5 per gender per group) or after a 3-month treatment-free period (2/5 per gender per group). Local and systemic reactions and MAGE-A3-specific immune responses (monkeys) were assessed. Macroscopic and microscopic (for rabbits, injection site only) post-mortem examinations were performed on all animals. No systemic toxicity or unscheduled mortalities were recorded. Single (rabbits) and repeated (monkeys; up to four times at the same site) injections were well tolerated. Following five to seven repeated injections, limb circumferences increased up to 26% (5 h post-injection), but returned to normal after 1-8 days. Three days after the last injection, enlargements of iliac, popliteal, axillary and inguinal lymph nodes, and increased incidence or severity of mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrates was observed in injected muscles of treated monkeys. No treatment-related macroscopic findings were recorded after the treatment-free period. MAGE-A3-specific antibody and T-cell responses were raised in all treated monkeys, confirming test item exposure. Single or repeated intramuscular injections of MAGE-A3 Cancer Immunotherapeutic were well tolerated in rabbits and monkeys.},

  abstract        = {Filtered shot noise processes have proven to be very effective in modeling the evolution of systems exposed to shot noise sources and have been applied to a wide variety of fields ranging from electronics through biology. In particular, they can model the membrane potential V(m) of neurons driven by stochastic input, where these filtered processes are able to capture the nonstationary characteristics of V(m) fluctuations in response to presynaptic input with variable rate. In this paper we apply the general framework of Poisson point processes transformations to analyze these systems in the general case of nonstationary input rates. We obtain exact analytic expressions, as well as different approximations, for the joint cumulants of filtered shot noise processes with multiplicative noise. These general results are then applied to a model of neuronal membranes subject to conductance shot noise with a continuously variable rate of presynaptic spikes. We propose very effective approximations for the time evolution of the V(m) distribution and a simple method to estimate the presynaptic rate from a small number of V(m) traces. This work opens the perspective of obtaining analytic access to important statistical properties of conductance-based neuronal models such as the first passage time.},

Safety pharmacology studies evaluated the cardiorespiratory effects of AS in conscious telemetered dogs and in anaesthetised rats. Sixteen telemetered beagle dogs (4/group) received intramuscular injections of saline at Day 0, and one clinical dose of AS01, AS03, AS04 or AS15 at Day 7 (7× the equivalent human dose on a bodyweight basis). Bodyweights were measured through Day 14 and cardiorespiratory parameters and body temperature through 72 h post-treatment. Anaesthetised rats (4/group) received one intravenous injection of AS01, AS03 or AS15 at 1 mL/kg bodyweight (140× the equivalent human dosages), or saline. Cardiorespiratory parameters were measured for 120 min post-dose. In dogs, food consumption and mean bodyweight decreased with AS03, and mean body temperature slightly increased with AS01, AS03 and AS15, but were not considered to be adverse. Cardiovascular effects (a slight, reversible increase in mean heart rate and shortened mean RR/PR/QT-intervals) were observed with AS15. No relevant clinical effects or effects on QRS-complex/QTc-interval durations, arterial pressure or respiratory parameters were observed. In rats, there were no consistent treatment-related effects. Collectively, this suggests that AS01, AS03, AS04 and AS15 are not associated with potentially deleterious effects on ventricular repolarisation, atrio/intra-ventricular conductivities or respiratory functions.},

The theory that accounts for the genesis of neuronal magnetic fields involves dendritic cable structures in homogeneous resistive extracellular media. Here we generalize this model by considering dendritic cables in extracellular media with arbitrarily complex electric properties. This method is based on a multiscale mean-field theory where the neuron is considered in interaction with a "mean" extracellular medium (characterized by a specific impedance). We first show that, as expected, the generalized cable equation and the standard cable generate magnetic fields that mostly depend on the axial current in the cable, with a moderate contribution of extracellular currents. Less expected, we also show that the nature of the extracellular and intracellular media influence the axial current, and thus also influence neuronal magnetic fields. We illustrate these properties by numerical simulations and suggest experiments to test these findings.},

  abstract        = {Advancing the size and complexity of neural network models leads to an ever increasing demand for computational resources for their simulation. Neuromorphic devices offer a number of advantages over conventional computing architectures, such as high emulation speed or low power consumption, but this usually comes at the price of reduced configurability and precision. In this article, we investigate the consequences of several such factors that are common to neuromorphic devices, more specifically limited hardware resources, limited parameter configurability and parameter variations due to fixed-pattern noise and trial-to-trial variability. Our final aim is to provide an array of methods for coping with such inevitable distortion mechanisms. As a platform for testing our proposed strategies, we use an executable system specification (ESS) of the BrainScaleS neuromorphic system, which has been designed as a universal emulation back-end for neuroscientific modeling. We address the most essential limitations of this device in detail and study their effects on three prototypical benchmark network models within a well-defined, systematic workflow. For each network model, we start by defining quantifiable functionality measures by which we then assess the effects of typical hardware-specific distortion mechanisms, both in idealized software simulations and on the ESS. For those effects that cause unacceptable deviations from the original network dynamics, we suggest generic compensation mechanisms and demonstrate their effectiveness. Both the suggested workflow and the investigated compensation mechanisms are largely back-end independent and do not require additional hardware configurability beyond the one required to emulate the benchmark networks in the first place. We hereby provide a generic methodological environment for configurable neuromorphic devices that are targeted at emulating large-scale, functional neural networks.},

  abstract        = {Electrophysiological recordings of single neurons in brain tissues are very common in neuroscience. Glass microelectrodes filled with an electrolyte are used to impale the cell membrane in order to record the membrane potential or to inject current. Their high resistance induces a high voltage drop when passing current and it is essential to correct the voltage measurements. In particular, for voltage clamping, the traditional alternatives are two-electrode voltage-clamp technique or discontinuous single electrode voltage-clamp (dSEVC). Nevertheless, it is generally difficult to impale two electrodes in a same neuron and the switching frequency is limited to low frequencies in the case of dSEVC. We present a novel fully computer-implemented alternative to perform continuous voltage-clamp recordings with a single sharp-electrode. To reach such voltage-clamp recordings, we combine an active electrode compensation algorithm (AEC) with a digital controller (AECVC). We applied two types of control-systems: a linear controller (proportional plus integrative controller) and a model-based controller (optimal control). We compared the performance of the two methods to dSEVC using a dynamic model cell and experiments in brain slices. The AECVC method provides an entirely digital method to perform continuous recording and smooth switching between voltage-clamp, current clamp or dynamic-clamp configurations without introducing artifacts.},

The evaluation included non-clinical studies in rabbits to evaluate the local intramuscular tolerance following administration on a single occasion, and the local and systemic effects following repeated administrations of RTS,S/AS01 or RTS,S/AS02 formulations. In the first study, rabbits were injected on one occasion with RTS,S/AS01, RTS,S/AS02 or controls, and the local intramuscular tolerance was evaluated up to 3 days after injection. In the second study, the different formulations were injected on Days 0, 14, 28 and 42. General health status, haematology and blood chemistry parameters were monitored on a regular basis. Macroscopic and microscopic evaluations were made after termination of the study. No sign of toxicity was detected following single or repeated administrations of the adjuvanted RTS,S formulations. Changes in haematology or clinical chemistry parameters were indicative of a developing immune response in the groups receiving either RTS,S formulation. All examined parameters returned to normal within 28 days after the last injection. The absence of toxicological effects following the injection of RTS,S/AS01 or RTS,S/AS02 in rabbits was supportive of further clinical evaluation of these two formulations.},

  abstract        = {Epidemiological data from several European countries suggested an increased risk of the chronic sleep disorder narcolepsy following vaccination with Pandemrix(™), an AS03-adjuvanted, pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza vaccine. Further research to investigate potential associations between Pandemrix™ vaccination, A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza infection and narcolepsy is required. Narcolepsy is most commonly caused by a reduction or absence of hypocretin produced by hypocretin-secreting neurons in the hypothalamus, and is tightly associated with HLA-II DQB1*06:02. Consequently, research focusing on CD4(+) T-cell responses, building on the hypothesis that for disease development, T cells specific for antigen(s) from hypocretin neurons must be activated or reactivated, is considered essential. Therefore, the following key areas of research can be identified, (1) characterization of hypothetical narcolepsy-specific auto-immune CD4(+) T cells, (2) mapping epitopes of such T cells, and (3) evaluating potential mechanisms that would enable such cells to gain access to the hypothalamus. Addressing these questions could further our understanding of the potential links between narcolepsy and A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination and/or infection. Of particular interest is that any evidence of a mimicry-based mechanism could also explain the association between narcolepsy and A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza infection.},

  abstract        = {The rodent whisker system became one of the main system models for the study of the functional properties of sensory neurons. This is due on one hand to the detailed knowledge that we have on the afferent pathways linking the mechanoreceptors in the follicles to the primary somatosensory cortex and on the other hand to the possibility of controlling the sensory input at a micrometer and millisecond scale. The observation of the natural use of the whiskers by rodents indicates that exploration of objects and textures imply multiple contacts with tens of whiskers simultaneously. We have studied the neural code in the barrel cortex, which receives tactile information from the whiskers. By combining multi-electrode recordings and controlled multiwhisker tactile stimulation with theoretical analysis, we have observed a dependence of neural responses on the statistics of the sensory input. Several classes of neuronal responses, similar to those described in a number of cortical visual areas, were observed in the same cortical volume, indicating that various coding schemes are implemented in the same cortical network and can be put into play differentially to cope with the changing statistics of the peripheral stimuli.},

  abstract        = {Inflammatory reactions are one of the potential safety concerns that are evaluated in the framework of vaccine safety testing. In nonclinical studies, the assessment of the inflammation relies notably on the measurement of biomarkers. C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase plasma protein of hepatic origin that could be used for that purpose in toxicity studies with rabbits. To evaluate the utility of CRP as an additional inflammatory biomarker in adjuvant or vaccine toxicity studies, rabbits were injected on Day 0 with saline, aluminium phosphate, aluminium hydroxide, Adjuvant System (AS)01, AS03, AS15, or diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis-hepatitis B vaccine (DTPw-HB). Body weights, haematology parameters, CRP and fibrinogen levels were measured daily up to Day 7. Macroscopic changes at the injection site were also evaluated up to Day 7. At Day 7, a histopathological examination of the injection site was performed. Like fibrinogen, CRP levels rapidly increased after the injection of Adjuvant Systems or DTPw-HB, peaking at Day 1, and returning to baseline in less than a week. The magnitude of the CRP increase was consistently higher than that of fibrinogen with a larger fold increase from background, providing a more sensitive evaluation. The number of circulating heterophils was also increased on Day 1 after the injection of Adjuvant Systems or DTPw-HB. The highest increases in CRP levels were observed after the injection of DTPw-HB or AS03, and were also associated with the persistence of mixed inflammatory cell infiltrates (including heterophils) at the injection sites on Day 7. No increases in CRP levels and in circulating heterophils were observed after injection of the aluminium salt adjuvants. Our study supports the use of CRP as an accurate biomarker of acute inflammation in rabbits for vaccine toxicity studies and highlights an association between increased CRP levels and the recruitment of heterophils.},

However, extracellular media may display more complex electrical properties due to various phenomena, such as polarization, ionic diffusion, or capacitive effects, but their impact on cable properties is not known. In this paper, we generalize cable theory for membranes embedded in arbitrarily complex extracellular media. We outline the generalized cable equations, then consider specific cases. The simplest case is a resistive medium, in which case the equations recover the traditional cable equations. We show that for more complex media, for example, in the presence of ionic diffusion, the impact on cable properties such as voltage attenuation can be significant. We illustrate this numerically, always by comparing the generalized cable to the traditional cable. We conclude that the nature of intracellular and extracellular media may have a strong influence on cable filtering as well as on the passive integrative properties of neurons.},

These models are based on an analytical approximation of the differential equation describing the IF neuron with exponential synaptic conductances and were successfully tested with respect to their response to random and oscillating inputs. Because they are analytical and mathematically simple, the gIF models are best suited for fast event-driven simulation strategies. However, the drawback of such models is they rely on a nonrealistic postsynaptic potential (PSP) time course, consisting of a discontinuous jump followed by a decay governed by the membrane time constant. Here, we address this limitation by conceiving an analytical approximation of the COBA IF neuron model with the full PSP time course. The subthreshold and suprathreshold response of this gIF4 model reproduces remarkably well the postsynaptic responses of the numerically solved passive membrane equation subject to conductance noise, while gaining at least two orders of magnitude in computational performance. Although the analytical structure of the gIF4 model is more complex than that of its predecessors due to the necessity of calculating future spike times, a simple and fast algorithmic implementation for use in large-scale neural network simulations is proposed.},

  abstract        = {During light slow-wave sleep, the thalamo-cortical network oscillates in waxing-and-waning patterns at about 7 to 14 Hz and lasting for 500 ms to 3 s, called spindles, with the thalamus rhythmically sending strong excitatory volleys to the cortex. Concurrently, the hippocampal activity is characterized by transient and strong excitatory events, Sharp-Waves-Ripples (SPWRs), directly affecting neocortical activity--in particular the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)--which receives monosynaptic fibers from the ventral hippocampus and subiculum. Both spindles and SPWRs have been shown to be strongly involved in memory consolidation. However, the dynamics of the cortical network during natural sleep spindles and how prefrontal circuits simultaneously process hippocampal and thalamo-cortical activity remain largely undetermined. Using multisite neuronal recordings in rat mPFC, we show that during sleep spindles, oscillatory responses of cortical cells are different for different cell types and cortical layers. Superficial neurons are more phase-locked and tonically recruited during spindle episodes. Moreover, in a given layer, interneurons were always more modulated than pyramidal cells, both in firing rate and phase, suggesting that the dynamics are dominated by inhibition. In the deep layers, where most of the hippocampal fibers make contacts, pyramidal cells respond phasically to SPWRs, but not during spindles. Similar observations were obtained when analyzing γ-oscillation modulation in the mPFC. These results demonstrate that during sleep spindles, the cortex is functionnaly "deafferented" from its hippocampal inputs, based on processes of cortical origin, and presumably mediated by the strong recruitment of inhibitory interneurons. The interplay between hippocampal and thalamic inputs may underlie a global mechanism involved in the consolidation of recently formed memory traces.},

The associative plasticity rules demonstrated in vitro, mostly in silent networks, are based on the detection of correlations between presynaptic and postsynaptic activity and hence are sensitive to spontaneous activity and spurious correlations. Therefore, they cannot operate in realistic network states. Here, we present a new class of spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning rules with local floating plasticity thresholds, the slow dynamics of which account for metaplasticity. This novel algorithm is shown to both correctly predict homeostasis in synaptic weights and solve the problem of asymptotic stable learning in noisy states. It is shown to naturally encompass many other known types of learning rule, unifying them into a single coherent framework. The mixed presynaptic and postsynaptic dependency of the floating plasticity threshold is justified by a cascade of known molecular pathways, which leads to experimentally testable predictions.},

Less conventional than software-based systems, hardware-based solutions generally combine digital and analog forms of computation. In previous work, we designed several neuromimetic chips, including the Galway chip that we used for this paper. These silicon neurons are based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism and they are optimized for reproducing a large variety of neuron behaviors thanks to tunable parameters. Due to process variation and device mismatch in analog chips, we use a full-custom fitting method in voltage-clamp mode to tune our neuromimetic integrated circuits. By comparing them with experimental electrophysiological data of these cells, we show that the circuits can reproduce the main firing features of cortical cell types. In this paper, we present the experimental measurements of our system which mimic the four most prominent biological cells: fast spiking, regular spiking, intrinsically bursting, and low-threshold spiking neurons into analog neuromimetic integrated circuit dedicated to cortical neuron simulations. This hardware and software platform will allow to improve the hybrid technique, also called "dynamic-clamp," that consists of connecting artificial and biological neurons to study the function of neuronal circuits.},

Recent experimental evidence indicates that in the cortex, in addition to the silencing of a fraction of neurons, other neurons are hyperactive in amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque-enriched regions. However, it has remained unknown what comes first, neuronal silencing or hyperactivity, and what mechanisms might underlie the primary neuronal dysfunction. Here we examine the activity patterns of hippocampal CA1 neurons in a mouse model of AD in vivo using two-photon Ca(2+) imaging. We found that neuronal activity in the plaque-bearing CA1 region of older mice is profoundly altered. There was a marked increase in the fractions of both silent and hyperactive neurons, as previously also found in the cortex. Remarkably, in the hippocampus of young mice, we observed a selective increase in hyperactive neurons already before the formation of plaques, suggesting that soluble species of Aβ may underlie this impairment. Indeed, we found that acute treatment with the γ-secretase inhibitor LY-411575 reduces soluble Aβ levels and rescues the neuronal dysfunction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that direct application of soluble Aβ can induce neuronal hyperactivity in wild-type mice. Thus, our study identifies hippocampal hyperactivity as a very early functional impairment in AD transgenic mice and provides direct evidence that soluble Aβ is crucial for hippocampal hyperactivity.},

Axonal arbors from populations of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the D2 column were labeled by lentivirus-mediated expression of green fluorescent protein. Axonal projection patterns were compared between untrimmed control animals and animals with all whiskers in A-, B-, and C-rows trimmed (D- and E-rows left intact) from postnatal days 7 to 15 (termed from here on DE-pairing). Control animals had approximately symmetrical horizontal projections toward C- and E-row columns in both supra- and infragranular layers. Following DE-pairing, the density of axons in supragranular layers projecting from the labeled neurons in the D2 column was higher in E- than in C-row columns. This asymmetry resulted primarily from a reduction in projection density toward the deprived C-row columns. In contrast, no change was observed in infragranular layers. The results indicate that DE-pairing during early postnatal development results in reduced axonal projection from nondeprived into deprived columns and that cortical neurons are capable of structural rearrangements at subsets of their axonal arbors.},

Responses to deflection of D-row whiskers were recorded after trimming of A-row, B-row, and C-row whiskers, referred to as DE pairing, during postnatal development. Animals DE paired from postnatal day (p) 7 to p17 had a significant bias in the spread of the vsd signal, favoring spread toward the concomitantly nondeprived E-row columns. This resulted primarily from a strong decrease in signal spreading into the deprived C-row columns. In contrast, signal spread in control littermates was approximately symmetrical. DE pairing failed to elicit significant changes when begun after p14, thus defining a critical period for this phenomenon. The results suggest that sensory deprivation in this model results in lower connectivity being established between nondeprived columns and adjacent deprived ones.},

With his death, we lost one of the most distinguished biophysicists of our time. He laid the foundations for our understanding of almost every aspect of synaptic transmission. Bernard Katz revealed the existence of key molecules and formally described their interaction. With the benefit of his almost magical intuition, he formulated hypotheses that are now recognized as facts. During his career he pioneered research in three areas. He and Alan Hodgkin elucidated the ionic basis of the action potential overshoot, as formulated in the sodium hypothesis; he unravelled the biophysical mechanisms that generate the endplate potential; and he clarified mechanisms of transmitter release, as detailed in the quantal hypothesis and the vesicle hypothesis. In particular his work on the neuromuscular junction influenced and led several generations of neurophysiologists, and it continues to do so even though research focus has shifted to synapses in the central nervous system. Bernard Katz (or BK, as he was known to colleagues and students) trained several generations of young investigators who have been inspired by his hypotheses, by his impeccable thoroughness as an investigator, and by the straightforward, unpretentious style of his presentations - though some have been dismayed by his occasional unapproachability or his unforgiving nature when confronted with others' mistakes! Perhaps his most valuable and enduring legacy to collaborators and students is that, when data are difficult to interpret and we see only a faint glimmer of light at the end of a long tunnel, we ask ourselves, 'What would BK do now?'},

In particular, the expression of the GluR-B subunit determines the divalent ion selectivity of the channel. We studied the distribution of GluR-B mRNA and protein in adult rat hippocampal GABAergic neurons combining non-radioactive in situ hybridization with immunocytochemistry. The majority of GABAergic hippocampal neurons were GluR-B mRNA-positive, but overall the levels of GluR-B transcript were lower than in pyramidal and granule cells, which showed the highest hybridization signal. The different GluR-B mRNA expression levels in GABAergic versus principal neurons were also observed at the protein level. There was a paucity of GluR-B/C immunoreactivity in the vast majority of somata of the GABAergic neurons studied, which contrasted with the strong expression of GluR-B/C proteins in the hippocampal principal neurons. Our results demonstrate the general low expression of the GluR-B subunit mRNA and GluR-B/C proteins in GABAergic hippocampal neurons. Considering the dominant role of the GluR-B subunit in determining the divalent ion permeability of the receptor, it is likely that most GABAergic neurons express AMPA receptor channels with different calcium permeabilities.},

Pair recordings showed that short bursts of backpropagating dendritic action potentials (APs) reduced the amplitude of unitary EPSPs. EPSP depression was dependent on a rise in dendritic [Ca2+]. The effect was blocked by the GABA(B) receptor (GABA(B)-R) antagonist CGP55845A and was mimicked by the GABA(B)-R agonist baclofen. As presynaptic GABA(B)-Rs were activated neither by somatostatin nor by GABA released from axon collaterals of the bitufted cell, we conclude that GABA(B)-Rs were activated by a retrograde messenger, most likely GABA, released from the dendrite. Because synaptic depression was prevented by loading bitufted neurons with GDP-beta-S, it is likely to be caused by exocytotic GABA release from dendrites.},

Here, we report a GluR-A-independent form of LTP, which is comparable in size to LTP in wild-type mice at postnatal day 14 (P14) but diminishes between P14 and P42 in brain slices of GluR-A-deficient mice. The GluR-A-independent form of LTP is sensitive to D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP5), but lacks short-term potentiation (STP) and can also be observed in the pairing induction protocol. As judged by unaltered paired-pulse facilitation, this LTP form is postsynaptically expressed despite depleted extrasynaptic AMPA receptor pools with reduced levels of GluR-B, which accumulates in somata and synapses of CA1 pyramidal neurons in GluR-A-deficient mice.

Of six types of Ca2+ channels, L-, N-, P-, Q-, R-, and T-type, only N- and P/Q-type channels have been pharmacologically identified to mediate action-potential-evoked transmitter release in the mammalian central nervous system. We tested whether Ca2+ channels other than N- and P/Q-type control transmitter release in a calyx-type synapse of the rat medial nucleus of the trapezoid body. Simultaneous recordings of presynaptic Ca2+ influx and the excitatory postsynaptic current evoked by a single action potential were made at single synapses. The R-type channel, a high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channel resistant to L-, N-, and P/Q-type channel blockers, contributed 26% of the total Ca2+ influx during a presynaptic action potential. This Ca2+ current evoked transmitter release sufficiently large to initiate an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron. The R-type current controlled release with a lower efficacy than other types of Ca2+ currents. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors and gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptors inhibited the R-type current. Because a significant fraction of presynaptic Ca2+ channels remains unidentified in many other central synapses, the R-type current also could contribute to evoked transmitter release in these synapses.},

  abstract        = {The channel of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) transports Ca2+ approximately four times more efficiently than that of Ca2+-permeable alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptors (AMPAR). To investigate the basis of this difference in these glutamate receptors (GluRs), we measured the ratio of Cs+ efflux and Ca2+ influx in recombinant NMDAR and Ca2+-permeable AMPAR channels expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells over a wide voltage range. At any one potential, this biionic flux ratio was measured by quantifying the total charge and the charge carried by Ca2+ using whole-cell currents and fluorometric techniques (dye overload) with Cs+ internally and Ca2+ externally (1.8 or 10 mM) as the only permeant ions. In AMPAR channels, composed of either GluR-A(Q) or GluR-B(Q) subunits, the biionic flux ratio had a biionic flux-ratio exponent of 1, consistent with the prediction of the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz current equation. In contrast, for NMDAR channels composed of NR1 and NR2A subunits, the biionic flux-ratio exponent was approximately 2, indicating a deviation from Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz. Consistent with these results, in NMDAR channels under biionic conditions with high external Ca2+ and Cs+ as the reference ions, Ca2+ permeability (PCa/PCs) was concentration dependent, being highest around physiological concentrations (1-1.8 mM; PCa/PCs approximately 6.1) and reduced at both higher (110 mM; PCa/PCs approximately 2.6) and lower (0.18 mM; PCa/PCs approximately 2.2) concentrations. PCa/PCs in AMPAR channels was not concentration dependent, being around 1.65 in 0.3-110 mM Ca2+. In AMPAR and NMDAR channels, the Q/R/N site is a critical determinant of Ca2+ permeability. However, mutant AMPAR channels, which had an asparagine substituted at the Q/R site, also showed a biionic flux-ratio exponent of 1 and concentration-independent permeability ratios, indicating that the difference in Ca2+ transport is not due to the amino acid residue located at the Q/R/N site. We suggest that the difference in Ca2+ transport properties between the glutamate receptor subtypes reflects that the pore of NMDAR channels has multiple sites for Ca2+, whereas that of AMPAR channels only a single site.},

To estimate the dimensions of the narrow portion of these channels, biionic reversal potentials for organic cations of different mean diameters were determined with Cs+ as the internal reference ion. 2. Homomeric channels assembled from Q-form subunits were cation selective. The relation between the relative permeability and the mean size of different organic cations suggests that the diameter of the narrow portion of Q-form channels is approximately 0.78 nm for AMPAR and 0.75 nm for KAR channels. 3. Homomeric channels assembled from R-form subunits were permeant for anions and cations. When probed with CsC1 gradients the relative chloride permeability (PC1/PCs) was estimated as 0.14 for GluR-B(R) and 0.74 for GluR-6(R)-subunit channels. The permeability versus mean size relation for large cations measured with the weakly permeant F- as anion, indicates that for the R-form KAR channels the apparent pore diameter is close to 0.76 nm. 4. Heteromeric AMPAR and KAR channels co-assembled from Q- and R-form subunits were cation selective. The diameter of the narrow portion of these channels is estimated to be in the range between 0.70 and 0.74 nm. 5. The results indicated that the diameters of the narrow portion of AMPAR and KAR channels of different subunit composition and of widely different ion selectivity are comparable. Therefore, the differences in the anion versus cation selectivity, in Ca2+ permeability and in channel conductance are likely to be determined by the difference in charge density of the channel.},

The GluR-B subunit is dominant in determining functional properties of heteromeric AMPA receptors. This subunit exists in developmentally distinct edited and unedited forms, GluR-B(R) and GluR-B(Q), which differ in a single amino acid in transmembrane segment TM2 (Q/R site). Homomeric GluR-B(R) channels expressed in 293 cells display a low divalent permeability, whereas homomeric GluR-B(Q) and GluR-D channels exhibit a high divalent permeability. Mutational analysis revealed that both the positive charge and the size of the amino acid side chain located at the Q/R site control the divalent permeability of homomeric channels. Coexpression of Q/R site arginine- and glutamine-containing subunits generates cells with varying divalent permeabilities depending on the amounts of expression vectors used for cell transfection. Intermediate divalent permeabilities were traced to the presence of both divalent permeant homomeric and impermeant heteromeric channels. It is suggested that the positive charge contributed by the arginine of the edited GluR-B(R) subunit determines low divalent permeability in heteromeric GluR channels and that changes in GluR-B(R) expression regulate the AMPA receptor-dependent divalent permeability of a cell.},

The relation between Ca2+ permeability of AMPAR channels and the relative GluR-B mRNA abundance is consistent with the dominance of this subunit in determining the Ca2+ permeability of native receptors.

Simultaneous fluorescence and whole-cell current measurements using the calcium indicator dye fura-2 were made in HEK 293 cells expressing recombinant glutamate receptor (GluR) channels, and fractional Ca2+ currents (the proportion of whole-cell current carried by Ca2+; Pf) were determined. 2. Cells expressing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) channels showed glutamate activated Ca2+ inflow in the voltage range -60 to 40 mV in normal extracellular solution. Ca2+ inflow decreased in a voltage-dependent manner at membrane potentials more negative than -30 mV due to Mg2+ block. Voltage dependence of block at negative potentials was stronger in cells expressing the NR1-NR2A as compared with cells expressing NR1-NR2C subunits. 3. Fractional Ca2+ currents through NMDARs were independent of extracellular Mg2+ and varied between 8.2% (NR1-NR2C subunits) and 11% (NR1-NR2A subunits) in normal extracellular solution (1.8 mM Ca2+) at -60 mV membrane potential. Pf values increased with increasing [Ca2+]o in the range of 0.5-10mM [Ca2+]o in a saturating fashion. 4. In cells expressing alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptor (AMPAR) subunits which were unedited at the Q/R site of the putative transmembrane segment TM2 (Q-form), or in cells coexpressing unedited and edited subunits (R-form), the glutamate-evoked Ca2+ inflow increased from 20 to -80 mV in an almost linear way. 5. Fractional Ca2+ currents through AMPAR channels depended on subunit composition. Pf values of Q-form homomeric channels at -60 mV and 1.8 mM [Ca2+]o were between 3.2 and 3.9%. They were slightly voltage dependent and increased with [Ca2+]o in the range 1.8-10mM. Pf values in cells co-expressing Q- and R-form subunits were almost one order of magnitude smaller (0.54%). 6. Relative concentrations of Q-form and R-form GluR-B subunit-specific cDNAs used for cell transfection determined the expression of functionally different heteromeric AMPARS. Pf decreased with increasing relative concentration of R-form encoding CDNAs from 3.4 to 1.4%, demonstrating that editing of the Q/R site of GluR-B subunits decreases Ca2+ inflow through heteromeric AMPARs. 7. Cells expressing the GluR-6 subunit of the kainate receptor (KAR) family were characterized by Pf values which depended on the editing in the TM1 and TM2 segments. Pf values were largest for the Q-form (1.55-2.0%) and lowest for R-form channels (< 0.2%), suggesting that Q/R site editing also decreases Ca2+ inflow through KAR channels. Cells co-expressing both subunit forms showed an intermediate value (0.58%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The presence of GluR-B subunits in heteromeric GluRs determined the I-V behavior of the resulting channels. Site-directed mutagenesis identified a single amino acid difference (glutamine to arginine) in the putative transmembrane segment TM2 responsible for subunit-specific I-V relationships.

  abstract        = {The fine structure of ion-channel activations by junctional nicotinic receptors in adult frog muscle fibres has been investigated. The agonists used were acetylcholine (ACh), carbachol (CCh), suberyldicholine (SubCh) and decan-1,10-dicarboxylic acid dicholine ester (DecCh). Individual activations (bursts) were interrupted by short closed periods; the distribution of their durations showed a major fast component ('short gaps') and a minor slower component ('intermediate gaps'). The mean duration of both short and intermediate gaps was dependent on the nature of the agonist. For short gaps the mean durations (microseconds) were: ACh, 20; SubCh, 43; DecCh, 71; CCh, 13. The mean number of short gaps per burst were: ACh, 1.9; SubCh, 4.1; DecCh, 2.0. The mean number of short gaps per burst, and the mean number per unit open time, were dependent on the nature of the agonist, but showed little dependence on agonist concentration or membrane potential for ACh, SubCh and DecCh. The short gaps in CCh increased in frequency with agonist concentration and were mainly produced by channel blockages by CCh itself. Partially open channels (subconductance states) were clearly resolved rarely (0.4% of gaps within bursts) but regularly. Conductances of 18% (most commonly) and 71% of the main value were found. However, most short gaps were probably full closures. The distribution of burst lengths had two components. The faster component represented mainly isolated short openings that were much more common at low agonist concentrations. The slower component represented bursts of longer openings. Except at very low concentrations more than 85% of activations were of this type, which corresponds to the 'channel lifetime' found by noise analysis. The frequency of channel openings increased slightly with hyperpolarization. The short gaps during activations were little affected when (a) the [H+]o or [Ca2+]o were reduced to 1/10th of normal, (b) when extracellular Ca2+ was replaced by Mg2+, (c) when the [Cl-]i was raised or (d) when, in one experiment on an isolated inside-out patch, the normal intracellular constituents were replaced by KCl. Reduction of [Ca2+]O to 1/10 of normal increased the single-channel conductance by 50%, and considerably increased the number of intermediate gaps. No temporal asymmetry was detectable in the bursts of openings. Positive correlations were found between the lengths of successive apparent open times at low SubCh concentrations, but no correlations between burst lengths were detectable. The component of brief openings behaves, at low concentrations, as though it originates from openings of singly occupied channels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract        = {We have examined the events underlying the initiation of spontaneous action potentials (fibrillation) in fibres of previously denervated rat diaphragm maintained in organ culture for up to 10 days.1. Based on discharge pattern, two classes of spontaneously active fibres were found: rhythmically discharging fibres, and fibres in which action potentials occur at irregular intervals.2. Sites of action potentials initiation were located by exploration along the fibre length with two independent extracellular recording electrodes. The majority of sites of origin in both regular and irregular fibres were at the former end-plate zone; however, there was no region along the length that could not, at least in some fibres, be a site of origin.3. Intracellular recording at or near sites of origin of action potential discharge showed two types of initiating events. Irregularly discharging fibres were brought to threshold by discrete depolarizations of up to 15 mV in amplitude, while regularly occurring action potentials were associated with oscillations of the membrane potential.4. Discrete depolarizations (called fibrillatory origin potentials or f.o.p.s) at sites of origin in irregularly discharging fibres have the following properties: (a) random occurrence and nearly constant amplitude outside a refractory period during which both amplitude and probability of a second f.o.p. are reduced; (b) associated inward current flow which is localized to about 100 mum or less along the fibre length, and (c) dependence of amplitude and frequency on membrane potential.5. Oscillation of membrane potential found at sites of origin of action potential discharge in regular fibres also occurred locally along the fibre length and was sensitive to changes in membrane potential.6. Both f.o.p.s and oscillations of membrane potential were reversibly abolished by low Na(+)-Ringer fluid or tetrodotoxin.7. Neither type of initiating event was appreciably affected by concentrations of D-tubocurarine which blocked extrajunctional sensitivity to acetylcholine.8. We conclude that spontaneous action potentials under these conditions arise from a localized Na(+)-conductance change in the membrane of the active fibre; this conductance change is distinct from the increased Na(+)-conductance which follows the interaction of acetylcholine with its receptor. Spontaneous activity in single, denervated muscle fibres is cyclical and self-inhibiting (Purves & Sakmann, 1974); thus the Na(+)-conductance change underlying the initiation of spontaneous action potentials is affected by muscle fibre activity.},

Patch pipettes were used to apply depolarizing voltage steps and to record macroscopic sodium currents of between 50 and 750 pA from cell-attached patches of the oocyte membrane. With a combination of whole-cell and patch clamp recording, the properties of the implanted sodium channels could be studied in detail. They were analyzed according to the model of Hodgkin and Huxley (1952 a) assuming three activation gates. The activation of the sodium currents is characterized by an equilibrium potential of -29 mV and an apparent gating charge of 8.7 e0. At -64 mV half of the sodium currents were inactivated. From single-channel current recordings, an elementary sodium channel conductance of 19 pS and an average open time of 0.43 ms were obtained at -32 mV membrane potential and 16 degrees C. The single-channel and activation properties of rat brain sodium channel II are therefore comparable to those found in peripheral nerve and skeletal muscle, but inactivation occurs at less negative potentials. This could be a specific property of the brain sodium channels and may underlie the maintained inward sodium currents reported in brain neurones (French and Gage 1985).},

In epileptic patients, the use of ethanol can modify seizure initiation and subsequent seizure activity with reports of ethanol being both pro- and anticonvulsant. One proposed target of ethanol's actions is the neuromodulator adenosine, which is released during epileptic seizures to feedback and inhibit the occurrence of subsequent seizures. Here, we investigated the actions of acute ethanol exposure on adenosine signalling in rat hippocampus. We have combined electrophysiology with direct measurements of extracellular adenosine using microelectrode biosensors in rat hippocampal slices. We found that ethanol has bidirectional actions on adenosine signalling: depressant concentrations of ethanol (50 mM) increased the basal extracellular concentration of adenosine under baseline conditions, leading to the inhibition of synaptic transmission, but it inhibited adenosine release during evoked seizure activity in brain slices. The reduction in activity-dependent adenosine release was in part produced by effects on NMDA receptors, although other mechanisms also appeared to be involved. Low concentrations of ethanol (10-15 mM) enhanced pathological network activity by selectively blocking activity-dependent adenosine release. The complex dose-dependent actions of ethanol on adenosine signalling could in part explain the mixture of pro-convulsant and anticonvulsant actions of ethanol that have previously been reported.},

Quantifying the statistics of synaptic transmission requires stochastic models that link probabilistic neurotransmitter release with presynaptic spike-train statistics. Common approaches are to model the presynaptic spike train as either regular or a memory-less Poisson process: few analytical results are available that describe depressing synapses when the afferent spike train has more complex, temporally correlated statistics such as bursts. Here we present a series of analytical results-from vesicle release-site occupancy statistics, via neurotransmitter release, to the post-synaptic voltage mean and variance-for depressing synapses driven by correlated presynaptic spike trains. The class of presynaptic drive considered is that fully characterised by the inter-spike-interval distribution and encompasses a broad range of models used for neuronal circuit and network analyses, such as integrate-and-fire models with a complete post-spike reset and receiving sufficiently short-time correlated drive. We further demonstrate that the derived post-synaptic voltage mean and variance allow for a simple and accurate approximation of the firing rate of the post-synaptic neuron, using the exponential integrate-and-fire model as an example. These results extend the level of biological detail included in models of synaptic transmission and will allow for the incorporation of more complex and physiologically relevant firing patterns into future studies of neuronal networks.},

Adenosine can be released by a number of different mechanisms that include Ca  dependent processes such as the exocytosis of ATP. During sustained pathological network activity, ischemia and hypoxia the extracellular concentration of calcium ions (Ca ) markedly falls, inhibiting exocytosis and potentially reducing adenosine release. However it has been observed that reducing extracellular Ca  can induce paradoxical neural activity and can also increase adenosine release. Here we have investigated adenosine signaling and release mechanisms that occur when extracellular Ca  is removed. Using electrophysiology and microelectrode biosensor measurements we have found that adenosine is directly released into the extracellular space by the removal of extracellular Ca  and controls the induced neural activity via A  receptor-mediated membrane potential hyperpolarization. Following Ca  removal, adenosine is released via equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs), which when blocked leads to hyper-excitation. We propose that sustained action potential firing following Ca  removal leads to hydrolysis of ATP and a build-up of intracellular adenosine which then effluxes into the extracellular space via ENTs.},

A great deal of experimental and modeling effort has been directed at quantifying the response of the biosensors themselves; however, the influence that the macroscopic tissue environment has on biosensor response has not been subjected to the same level of scrutiny. Here we identify an important issue in the way microelectrode biosensors are calibrated that is likely to have led to underestimations of analyte tissue concentrations. Concentration in tissue is typically determined by comparing the biosensor signal to that measured in free-flow calibration conditions. In a free-flow environment the concentration of the analyte at the outer surface of the biosensor can be considered constant. However, in tissue the analyte reaches the biosensor surface by diffusion through the extracellular space. Because the enzymes in the biosensor break down the analyte, a density gradient is set up resulting in a significantly lower concentration of analyte near the biosensor surface. This effect is compounded by the diminished volume fraction (porosity) and reduction in the diffusion coefficient due to obstructions (tortuosity) in tissue. We demonstrate this effect through modeling and experimentally verify our predictions in diffusive environments.  Microelectrode biosensors are typically calibrated in a free-flow environment where the concentrations at the biosensor surface are constant. However, when in tissue, the analyte reaches the biosensor via diffusion and so analyte breakdown by the biosensor results in a concentration gradient and consequently a lower concentration around the biosensor. This effect means that naive free-flow calibration will underestimate tissue concentration. We develop mathematical models to better quantify the discrepancy between the calibration and tissue environment and experimentally verify our key predictions.},

  abstract     = {Synaptic transmission is both history-dependent and stochastic, resulting in varying responses to presentations of the same presynaptic stimulus. This complicates attempts to infer synaptic parameters and has led to the proposal of a number of different strategies for their quantification. Recently Bayesian approaches have been applied to make more efficient use of the data collected in paired intracellular recordings. Methods have been developed that either provide a complete model of the distribution of amplitudes for isolated responses or approximate the amplitude distributions of a train of post-synaptic potentials, with correct short-term synaptic dynamics but neglecting correlations. In both cases the methods provided significantly improved inference of model parameters as compared to existing mean-variance fitting approaches. However, for synapses with high release probability, low vesicle number or relatively low restock rate and for data in which only one or few repeats of the same pattern are available, correlations between serial events can allow for the extraction of significantly more information from experiment: a more complete Bayesian approach would take this into account also. This has not been possible previously because of the technical difficulty in calculating the likelihood of amplitudes seen in correlated post-synaptic potential trains; however, recent theoretical advances have now rendered the likelihood calculation tractable for a broad class of synaptic dynamics models. Here we present a compact mathematical form for the likelihood in terms of a matrix product and demonstrate how marginals of the posterior provide information on covariance of parameter distributions. The associated computer code for Bayesian parameter inference for a variety of models of synaptic dynamics is provided in the Supplementary Material allowing for quantal and dynamical parameters to be readily inferred from experimental data sets.},

  abstract        = {The presynaptic protein α-synuclein forms aggregates during Parkinson's disease. Accumulating evidence suggests that the small soluble oligomers of α-synuclein are more toxic than the larger aggregates appearing later in the disease. The link between oligomer toxicity and structure still remains unclear. In the present study, we have produced two structurally-defined oligomers that have a similar morphology but differ in secondary structure. These oligomers were introduced into neocortical pyramidal cells during whole-cell recording and, using a combination of experimentation and modelling, electrophysiological parameters were extracted. Both oligomeric species had similar effects on neuronal properties reducing input resistance, time constant and increasing capacitance. The net effect was a marked reduction in neuronal excitability that could impact on network activity. The presynaptic protein α-synuclein (αSyn) aggregates during Parkinson's disease (PD) to form large proteinaceous amyloid plaques, the spread of which throughout the brain clinically defines the severity of the disease. During early stages of aggregation, αSyn forms soluble annular oligomers that show greater toxicity than much larger fibrils. These oligomers produce toxicity via a number of possible mechanisms, including the production of pore-forming complexes that permeabilize membranes. In the present study, two well-defined species of soluble αSyn oligomers were produced by different protocols: by polymerization of monomer and by sonication of fibrils. The two oligomeric species produced were morphologically similar, with both having an annular structure and consisting of approximately the same number of monomer subunits, although they differed in their secondary structure. Oligomeric and monomeric αSyn were injected directly into the soma of pyramidal neurons in mouse neocortical brain slices during whole-cell patch clamp recording. Using a combined experimental and modelling approach, neuronal parameters were extracted to measure, for the first time in the neocortex, specific changes in neuronal electrophysiology. Both species of oligomer had similar effects: (i) a significant reduction in input resistance and the membrane time constant and (ii) an increase in the current required to trigger an action potential with a resultant reduction in the firing rate. Differences in oligomer secondary structure appeared to produce only subtle differences in the activity of the oligomers. Monomeric αSyn had no effect on neuronal parameters, even at high concentrations. The oligomer-induced fall in neuronal excitability has the potential to impact both network activity and cognitive processing.},

  abstract        = {Models of neocortical networks are increasingly including the diversity of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal classes. Significant variability in cellular properties are also seen within a nominal neuronal class and this heterogeneity can be expected to influence the population response and information processing in networks. Recent studies have examined the population and network effects of variability in a particular neuronal parameter with some plausibly chosen distribution. However, the empirical variability and covariance seen across multiple parameters are rarely included, partly due to the lack of data on parameter correlations in forms convenient for model construction. To addess this we quantify the heterogeneity within and between the neocortical pyramidal-cell classes in layers 2/3, 4, and the slender-tufted and thick-tufted pyramidal cells of layer 5 using a combination of intracellular recordings, single-neuron modelling and statistical analyses. From the response to both square-pulse and naturalistic fluctuating stimuli, we examined the class-dependent variance and covariance of electrophysiological parameters and identify the role of the h current in generating parameter correlations. A byproduct of the dynamic I-V method we employed is the straightforward extraction of reduced neuron models from experiment. Empirically these models took the refractory exponential integrate-and-fire form and provide an accurate fit to the perisomatic voltage responses of the diverse pyramidal-cell populations when the class-dependent statistics of the model parameters were respected. By quantifying the parameter statistics we obtained an algorithm which generates populations of model neurons, for each of the four pyramidal-cell classes, that adhere to experimentally observed marginal distributions and parameter correlations. As well as providing this tool, which we hope will be of use for exploring the effects of heterogeneity in neocortical networks, we also provide the code for the dynamic I-V method and make the full electrophysiological data set available.},

  abstract        = {Elucidation of cellular mechanisms regulating myometrial contractility is crucial for improvement in management of many obstetric abnormalities, such as premature delivery, uterine dystocia and post-partum haemorrhage. Myometrial contractions are triggered by periodic synchronous rises in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) elicited by spontaneously generated action potentials propagating throughout the entire myometrium. During labour, hormones like oxytocin and prostaglandins potentiate uterine contractions by increasing their duration, strength and frequency. The most informative approach to studying the mechanisms underlying hormonal modulation of uterine contractility is to record [Ca(2+)]i responses to hormones in intact myometrial samples that have not been subjected to enzymatic treatment for cell isolation or cell culture conditions. However, the spatio-temporal resolution of such recording is limited due to the motion artifacts occurring in contracting tissue. Here we describe the application of our newly developed motion correction algorithm to investigate the [Ca(2+)]i dynamics in control and oxytocin stimulated slices of human myometrium on a cellular level. We present evidence that oxytocin induces asynchronous [Ca(2+)]i oscillations in individual myocytes within intact myometrium which are similar to those observed in cultured cells. The oscillations occur between synchronous action potential-driven [Ca(2+)]i transients but appear to be unrelated to contractions. Furthermore, the oxytocin-triggered [Ca(2+)]i oscillations wane within 30-50min of hormone application, while the action potential induced [Ca(2+)]i transients remain augmented. We conclude that oxytocin-induced [Ca(2+)]i oscillations are not relevant to the acute regulation of myometrial contractility but may play a role in longer-term regulatory processes, for example, by triggering gene expression.},

  abstract        = {Although the patterns of activity produced by neocortical networks are now better understood, how these states are activated, sustained, and terminated still remains unclear. Negative feedback by the endogenous neuromodulator adenosine may potentially play an important role, as it can be released by activity and there is dense A1 receptor expression in the neocortex. Using electrophysiology, biosensors, and modeling, we have investigated the properties of adenosine signaling during physiological and pathological network activity in rat neocortical slices. Both low- and high-rate network activities were reduced by A1 receptor activation and enhanced by block of A1 receptors, consistent with activity-dependent adenosine release. Since the A1 receptors were neither saturated nor completely unoccupied during either low- or high-rate activity, adenosine signaling provides a negative-feedback mechanism with a wide dynamic range. Modeling and biosensor experiments show that during high-rate activity increases in extracellular adenosine concentration are highly localized and are uncorrelated over short distances that are certainly<500 μm. Modeling also predicts that the slow rise of the purine waveform cannot be from diffusion from distal release sites but more likely results from uptake and metabolism. The inability to directly measure adenosine release during low-rate activity, although it is present, is probably a consequence of small localized increases in adenosine concentration that are rapidly diminished by diffusion and active removal mechanisms. Saturation of such removal mechanisms when higher concentrations of adenosine are released results in the accumulation of inosine, explaining the strong purine signal during high-rate activity.},

  abstract        = {Successful childbirth depends on the occurrence of precisely coordinated uterine contractions during labour. Calcium indicator fluorescence imaging is one of the main techniques for investigating the mechanisms governing this physiological process and its pathologies. The effective spatiotemporal resolution of calcium signals is, however, limited by the motion of contracting tissue: structures of interest in the order of microns can move over a hundred times their width during a contraction. The simultaneous changes in local intensity and tissue configuration make motion tracking a non-trivial problem in image analysis and confound many of the standard techniques. This paper presents a method that tracks local motion throughout the tissue and allows for the almost complete removal of motion artefacts. This provides a stabilized calcium signal down to a pixel resolution, which, for the data examined, is in the order of a few microns. As a byproduct of image stabilization, a complete kinematic description of the contraction-relaxation cycle is also obtained. This contains novel information about the mechanical response of the tissue, such as the identification of a characteristic length scale, in the order of 40-50 μm, below which tissue motion is homogeneous. Applied to our data, we illustrate that the method allows for analyses of calcium dynamics in contracting myometrium in unprecedented spatiotemporal detail. Additionally, we use the kinematics of tissue motion to compare calcium signals at the subcellular level and local contractile motion. The computer code used is provided in a freely modifiable form and has potential applicability to in vivo calcium imaging of neural tissue, as well as other smooth muscle tissue.},

The number of independent release sites per presynaptic neuron, a synaptic parameter recently shown to be modified during long-term plasticity, will modulate these correlations and therefore have a significant effect on the firing rate of the postsynaptic neuron. To understand how correlations from synaptic dynamics and from presynaptic synchrony shape the postsynaptic response, we study a model of multiple release site short-term plasticity and derive exact results for the crosscorrelation function of vesicle occupancy and neurotransmitter release, as well as the postsynaptic voltage variance. Using approximate forms for the postsynaptic firing rate in the limits of low and high correlations, we demonstrate that short-term depression leads to a maximum response for an intermediate number of presynaptic release sites, and that this leads to a tuning-curve response peaked at an optimal presynaptic synchrony set by the number of neurotransmitter release sites per presynaptic neuron. These effects arise because, above a certain level of correlation, activity in the presynaptic population is overly strong resulting in wastage of the pool of releasable neurotransmitter. As the nervous system operates under constraints of efficient metabolism it is likely that this phenomenon provides an activity-dependent constraint on network architecture.},

Using paired recordings, we demonstrate that the developmental shift in release probability at synapses between rat somatosensory layer 5 thick-tufted pyramidal cells is mediated by a higher and more heterogeneous activation of presynaptic adenosine A1 receptors. Immature synapses under control conditions exhibited distributions of coefficient of variation, failure rate and release probability that were almost coincident with the A1 receptor blocked condition; however, mature synapses under control conditions exhibited much broader distributions that spanned those of both the A1 receptor agonized and antagonized conditions. Immature and mature synapses expressed A1 receptors with no observable difference in functional efficacy and therefore the heterogeneous A1 receptor activation seen in the mature neocortex appears due to increased adenosine concentrations that vary between synapses. Given the central role demonstrated for A1 receptor activation in determining synaptic amplitude and the statistics of transmission between mature layer 5 pyramidal cells, the emplacement of adenosine sources and sinks near the synaptic terminal could constitute a novel form of long-term synaptic plasticity.},

However, it is not known how the underlying functional components of synaptic transmission change over long time scales. To address this question, we studied cortical synapses from young Wistar rats before and after 12 h intervals of spontaneous or glutamate-induced spiking activity. We found that, under these conditions, synaptic efficacies can increase or decrease by up to 10-fold. Statistical analyses reveal that these changes reflect modifications in the number of presynaptic release sites, together with postsynaptic changes that maintain the quantal size per release site. The quantitative relation between the presynaptic and postsynaptic transmission components was not affected when synaptic plasticity was enhanced or reduced using a broad range of pharmacological agents. These findings suggest that ongoing synaptic plasticity results in matched presynaptic and postsynaptic modifications, in which elementary modules that span the synaptic cleft are added or removed as a function of experience.},

  abstract        = {The response of a neuronal population to afferent drive can be expected to be sensitive to both the distribution and dynamics of membrane voltages within the population. Voltage fluctuations can be driven by synaptic noise, neuromodulators, or cellular inhomogeneities: processes ranging from millisecond autocorrelation times to effectively static or "frozen" noise. Here we extend previous studies of filtered fluctuations to the experimentally verified exponential integrate-and-fire model. How fast or frozen fluctuations affect the steady-state rate and firing-rate response are both examined using perturbative solutions and limits of a 1 + 2 dimensional Fokker-Planck equation. The central finding is that, under conditions of a more-or-less constant population voltage variance, the firing-rate response is only weakly dependent on the fluctuation filter constant: The voltage distribution is the principal determinant of the population response. This result is unexpected given the nature of the systems underlying the extreme limits of fast and frozen fluctuations; the first limit represents a homogeneous population of neurons firing stochastically, whereas the second limit is equivalent to a heterogeneous population of neurons firing deterministically.},

  abstract        = {The purine adenosine is a potent neuromodulator in the brain, with roles in a number of diverse physiological and pathological processes. Modulators such as adenosine are difficult to study as once released they have a diffuse action (which can affect many neurones) and, unlike classical neurotransmitters, have no inotropic receptors. Thus rapid postsynaptic currents (PSCs) mediated by adenosine (equivalent to mPSCs) are not available for study. As a result the mechanisms and properties of adenosine release still remain relatively unclear. We have studied adenosine release evoked by stimulating the parallel fibres in the cerebellum. Using adenosine biosensors combined with deconvolution analysis and mathematical modelling, we have characterised the release dynamics and diffusion of adenosine in unprecedented detail. By partially blocking K+ channels, we were able to release adenosine in response to a single stimulus rather than a train of stimuli. This allowed reliable sub-second release of reproducible quantities of adenosine with stereotypic concentration waveforms that agreed well with predictions of a mathematical model of purine diffusion. We found no evidence for ATP release and thus suggest that adenosine is directly released in response to parallel fibre firing and does not arise from extracellular ATP metabolism. Adenosine release events showed novel short-term dynamics, including facilitated release with paired stimuli at millisecond stimulation intervals but depletion-recovery dynamics with paired stimuli delivered over minute time scales. These results demonstrate rich dynamics for adenosine release that are placed, for the first time, on a quantitative footing and show strong similarity with vesicular exocytosis.},

Although repeatedly observed at different brain regions and across layers, little is known about the synaptic characteristics that contribute to this wide range. In particular, the range could potentially be accounted for by differences in all three parameters of the quantal model of synaptic transmission, i.e. the number of release sites, release probability and quantal size. Here, we present a rigorous statistical analysis of the transmission properties of excitatory synaptic connections between layer-5 pyramidal neurons of the somato-sensory cortex. Our central finding is that the EPSP amplitude is strongly correlated with the number of estimated release sites, but not with the release probability or quantal size. In addition, we found that the number of release sites can be more than an order of magnitude higher than the typical number of synaptic contacts for this type of connection. Our findings indicate that transmission at stronger synaptic connections is mediated by multiquantal release from their synaptic contacts. We propose that modulating the number of release sites could be an important mechanism in regulating neocortical synaptic transmission.},

This limit includes many cases of biological interest, particularly under in vivo conditions of high synaptic conductance. The utility of the method is illustrated by applying it to two biophysically detailed models adapted from the literature: an entorhinal layer-II cortical neuron and a neuron featuring both calcium-activated and voltage-activated spike-frequency-adaptation currents. The framework generalizes to networks comprised of different neuronal classes and so will allow for the modeling of emergent states in neural tissue at significantly increased levels of biological detail.},

Here an elementary numerical scheme is demonstrated which can be used to calculate a number of biologically important properties of the general class of non-linear integrate-and-fire models. Exact results for the first-passage-time density and spike-train spectrum are derived, as well as the linear response properties and emergent states of recurrent networks. Given that the exponential integrate-fire model has recently been shown to agree closely with the experimentally measured response of pyramidal cells, the methodology presented here promises to provide a convenient tool to facilitate the analysis of cortical-network dynamics.},

Here a voltage-deconvolution technique is demonstrated that defilters the entire voltage trace to reveal an underlying signal of well-separated synaptic events. These isolated events can be cropped out and reconvolved to yield a set of isolated postsynaptic potentials from which voltage amplitudes may be measured directly-greatly simplifying this common task. The method also has the significant advantage of providing a higher temporal resolution of the dynamics of the underlying synaptic signal. The versatility of the method is demonstrated by a variety of experimental examples, including excitatory and inhibitory connections to neurons with passive membranes and those with activated voltage-gated currents. The deconvolved current-clamp voltage has many features in common with voltage-clamp current measurements. These similarities are analyzed using cable theory and a multicompartment cell reconstruction, as well as direct comparison to voltage-clamp experiments.},

Steady-state firing rates of both linear and nonlinear integrate-and-fire models, receiving fluctuating synaptic drive, can be calculated from the time-independent Fokker-Planck equation. The dynamic firing-rate response is less easy to extract, even at the first-order level of a weak modulation of the model parameters, but is an important determinant of neuronal response and network stability. For the linear integrate-and-fire model the response to modulations of current-based synaptic drive can be written in terms of hypergeometric functions. For the nonlinear exponential and quadratic models no such analytical forms for the response are available. Here it is demonstrated that a rather simple numerical method can be used to obtain the steady-state and dynamic response for both linear and nonlinear models to parameter modulation in the presence of current-based or conductance-based synaptic fluctuations. To complement the full numerical solution, generalized analytical forms for the high-frequency response are provided.

These synaptic pulses are mediated by conductance changes and therefore lead to increases or decreases of the neuronal membrane potential with amplitudes that are dependent on the voltage: synaptic noise is multiplicative. The statistics of the membrane potential are of experimental interest because the measurement of a single subthreshold voltage can be used to probe the activity occurring across the presynaptic population. Though the interpulse interval is not always significantly smaller than the characteristic decay time of the pulses, and so the fluctuations have the nature of shot noise, the majority of results available in the literature have been calculated in the diffusion limit, which is valid for high-rate pulses. Here the effects that multiplicative conductance noise and shot noise have on the voltage fluctuations are examined. It is shown that both these aspects of synaptic drive sculpt high-order features of the subthreshold voltage distribution, such as the skew. It is further shown that the diffusion approximation can only capture the effects arising from the multiplicative conductance noise, predicting a negative voltage skew for excitatory drive. Exact results for the full dynamics are derived from a master-equation approach, predicting positively skewed distributions with long tails in voltage ranges typical for action potential generation. It is argued that, although the skew is a high-order feature of subthreshold voltage distributions, the increased probability of reaching firing threshold suggests a potential role for shot noise in shaping the neuronal transfer function.},

It was recently found that conductance-based synaptic drive can lead to distributions with a significant skew. Here it is demonstrated that the underlying shot noise caused by Poissonian spike arrival also skews the membrane distribution, but in the opposite sense. Using a perturbative method, we analyze the effects of shot noise on the distribution of synaptic conductances and calculate the consequent voltage distribution. To first order in the perturbation theory, the voltage distribution is a gaussian modulated by a prefactor that captures the skew. The gaussian component is identical to distributions derived using current-based models with an effective membrane time constant. The well-known effective-time-constant approximation can therefore be identified as the leading-order solution to the full conductance-based model. The higher-order modulatory prefactor containing the skew comprises terms due to both shot noise and conductance fluctuations. The diffusion approximation misses these shot-noise effects implying that analytical approaches such as the Fokker-Planck equation or simulation with filtered white noise cannot be used to improve on the gaussian approximation. It is further demonstrated that quantities used for fitting theory to experiment, such as the voltage mean and variance, are robust against these non-Gaussian effects. The effective-time-constant approximation is therefore relevant to experiment and provides a simple analytic base on which other pertinent biological details may be added.},

  abstract        = {The synaptic drive from neuronal populations varies considerably over short time scales. Such changes in the pre-synaptic rate trigger many temporal processes absent under steady-state conditions. This paper examines the differential impact of pyramidal cell population bursts on post-synaptic pyramidal cells receiving depressing synapses, and on a class of interneuron that receives facilitating synapses. In experiment a significant shift of the order of one hundred milliseconds is seen between the response of these two cell classes to the same population burst. It is demonstrated here that such a temporal differentiation of the response can be explained by the synaptic and membrane properties without recourse to elaborate cortical wiring schemes. Experimental data is first used to construct models of the two types of dynamic synaptic response. A population-based approach is then followed to examine analytically the temporal synaptic filtering effects of the population burst for the two post-synaptic targets. The peak-to-peak delays seen in experiment can be captured by the model for experimentally realistic parameter ranges. It is further shown that the temporal separation of the response is communicated in the outgoing action potentials of the two post-synaptic cells: pyramidal cells fire at the beginning of the burst and the class of interneuron receiving facilitating synapses fires at the end of the burst. The functional role of such delays in the temporal organisation of activity in the cortical microcircuit is discussed.},

It was recently demonstrated that synaptic conductance effects in vivo significantly alter the integrative properties of neurons. These effects are missed in models that approximate the synaptic drive as a fluctuating current. Here the membrane-potential distribution and firing rate are derived for the integrate-and-fire neuron with delta correlated conductance-based synaptic input using the Fokker-Planck formalism. A number of different input scenarios are examined, including balanced drive and fluctuation changes at constant conductance, the latter of which corresponds to shifts in synchrony in the presynaptic population. This minimal model captures many experimentally observed conductance-related effects such as reduced membrane-potential fluctuations in response to increasing synaptic noise. The solvability of the model allows for a direct comparison with current-based approaches, providing a basis for assessing the validity of existing approximation schemes that have dealt with conductance change. In particular, a commonly used heuristic approach, whereby the passive membrane time constant is replaced by a drive-dependent effective time constant, is examined. It is demonstrated that this approximation is valid in the same limit that the underlying diffusion approximation holds, both for delta correlated as well as filtered synaptic drive.},

However, the influence of this subthreshold resonance on spiking properties has not yet been thoroughly analyzed. To this end, generalized integrate-and-fire models are introduced that reproduce at the linear level the subthreshold behavior of any given conductance-based model. A detailed analysis is presented of the simplest resonant model of this kind that has two variables: the membrane potential and a supplementary voltage-gated resonant variable. The firing-rate modulation created by a noisy weak oscillatory drive, mimicking an in vivo environment, is computed numerically and analytically when the dynamics of the resonant variable is slow compared to that of the membrane potential. The results show that the firing-rate modulation is shaped by the subthreshold resonance. For weak noise, the firing-rate modulation has a minimum near the preferred subthreshold frequency. For higher noise, such as that prevailing in vivo, the firing-rate modulation peaks near the preferred subthreshold frequency.},

  abstract        = {Many types of neurons exhibit subthreshold resonance. However, little is known about whether this frequency preference influences spike emission. Here, the link between subthreshold resonance and firing rate is examined in the framework of conductance-based models. A classification of the subthreshold properties of a general class of neurons is first provided. In particular, a class of neurons is identified in which the input impedance exhibits a suppression at a nonzero low frequency as well as a peak at higher frequency. The analysis is then extended to the effect of subthreshold resonance on the dynamics of the firing rate. The considered input current comprises a background noise term, mimicking the massive synaptic bombardment in vivo. Of interest is the modulatory effect an additional weak oscillating current has on the instantaneous firing rate. When the noise is weak and firing regular, the frequency most preferentially modulated is the firing rate itself. Conversely, when the noise is strong and firing irregular, the modulation is strongest at the subthreshold resonance frequency. These results are demonstrated for two specific conductance-based models and for a generalization of the integrate-and-fire model that captures subthreshold resonance. They suggest that resonant neurons are able to communicate their frequency preference to postsynaptic targets when the level of noise is comparable to that prevailing in vivo.},

  abstract        = {The movements of the human arm have been extensively studied for a variety of goal-directed experimental tasks. Analyses of the trajectory and velocity of the arm have led to many hypotheses for the planning strategies that the CNS might use. One family of control hypotheses, including minimum jerk, snap and their generalizations to higher orders, comprises those that favor smooth movements through the optimization of an integral cost function. The predictions of each order of this family are examined for two standard experimental tasks: point-to-point movements and the periodic tracing of figural forms, and compared both with experiment and the two-thirds power law. The aim of the analyses is to generalize previous numerical observations as well as to examine movement segmentation. It is first shown that contrary to recent statements in the literature, the only members of this family of control theories that match reaching movement experiments well are minimum jerk and snap. Then, for the case of periodic drawing, both the ellipse and cloverleaf are examined and the experimentally observed power law is derived from a first-principles approach. The results for the ellipse are particularly general, representing a unification of the two-thirds power law and smoothness hypotheses for ellipses of all reasonable eccentricities. For complex shapes it is shown that velocity profiles derived from the cost-function approach exhibit the same experimental features that were interpreted as segmented control by the CNS. Because the cost function contains no explicit segmented control, this result casts doubt on such an interpretation of the experimental data.},

In the present study, we report that trains of stimuli applied to local neocortical networks of cats, at frequencies that mimic endogenous brain rhythms, produced depression or potentiation of postsynaptic potentials, which lasted for several minutes. This form of synaptic plasticity was not mediated through NMDA receptors since it persisted after blockade of these receptors, but was strongly modulated by the level of background neuronal activity. Using different preparations in vivo, we found that increased background neuronal activity decreased the probability of plastic changes but enhanced the probability of potentiation over depression. Conversely, when the level of background neuronal activity was low, plasticity was observed in all neurons, but mainly depression was induced. Our results demonstrate that high levels of neuronal activity in the cortical network promote potentiation and insure the stability of synaptic connections.},

This dynamic I-V curve requires only a few tens of seconds of experimental time and so lends itself readily to the rapid classification of cell type, quantification of heterogeneities in cell populations, and generation of reduced analytical models. We apply this technique to layer-5 pyramidal cells and show that their dynamic I-V curve comprises linear and exponential components, providing experimental evidence for a recently proposed theoretical model. The approach also allows us to determine the change of neuronal response properties after a spike, millisecond by millisecond, so that postspike refractoriness of pyramidal cells can be quantified. Observations of I-V curves during and in absence of refractoriness are cast into a model that is used to predict both the subthreshold response and spiking activity of the neuron to novel stimuli. The predictions of the resulting model are in excellent agreement with experimental data and close to the intrinsic neuronal reproducibility to repeated stimuli.},

It is also demonstrated how the framework developed here can be generalized to multiplicative shot noise so as to better capture effects of the inhibitory reversal potential.},

An attractive feature of the method is that it can be used in spike-triggered mode to quantify the distinct patterns of post-spike refractoriness seen in different classes of cortical neuron. The method is first illustrated using a conductance-based model and is then applied experimentally to generate reduced models of cortical layer-5 pyramidal cells and interneurons, in injected-current and injected- conductance protocols. The resulting low-dimensional neuron models-of the refractory exponential integrate-and-fire type-provide highly accurate predictions for spike-times. The method therefore provides a useful tool for the construction of tractable models and rapid experimental classification of cortical neurons.},

  abstract     = {The local field potential (LFP) is an aggregate measure of group neuronal activity and is often correlated with the action potentials of single neurons. In recent years, investigators have found that action potential firing rates increase during elevations in power high-frequency band oscillations (50-200 Hz range). However, action potentials also contribute to the LFP signal itself, making the spike-LFP relationship complex. Here, we examine the relationship between spike rates and LFP in varying frequency bands in rat neocortical recordings. We find that 50-180 Hz oscillations correlate most consistently with high firing rates, but that other LFP bands also carry information relating to spiking, including in some cases anti-correlations. Relatedly, we find that spiking itself and electromyographic activity contribute to LFP power in these bands. The relationship between spike rates and LFP power varies between brain states and between individual cells. Finally, we create an improved oscillation-based predictor of action potential activity by specifically utilizing information from across the entire recorded frequency spectrum of LFP. The findings illustrate both caveats and improvements to be taken into account in attempts to infer spiking activity from LFP.},

In this study, we used dual site silicon probe recordings in freely moving mice to examine interactions between the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens in cocaine CPP. We found that CPP was associated with recruitment of D2-positive nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons to fire in the cocaine-paired location, and this recruitment was driven predominantly by selective strengthening of coupling with hippocampal place cells that encode the cocaine-paired location. These findings provide in vivo evidence suggesting that the synaptic potentiation in the accumbens caused by repeated cocaine administration preferentially affects inputs that were active at the time of drug exposure. This provides a potential physiological mechanism by which drug use becomes associated with specific environmental contexts.},

Firing rates, burstiness, and other electrophysiological features of neurons displayed unique layer and brain state dependence. Spike transmission strength from layer 2/3 cells to layer 5 pyramidal cells and interneurons was stronger during waking compared with non-REM sleep but stronger during non-REM sleep among deep-layer excitatory neurons.

In comparison with an optimized quad-core central processing unit (CPU) implementation, our approach achieves an ∼20- to 50-fold increase in speed in eight tested rat hippocampal, cortical, and thalamic ensemble recordings, with real-time decoding speed (approximately fraction of a millisecond per spike) and scalability up to thousands of channels.

A challenge for creating long-term stable interfaces between electronics and neural tissue is the huge mechanical mismatch between the systems. So far, materials and fabrication processes have restricted the development of soft electrode grids able to combine high performance, long-term stability, and high electrode density, aspects all essential for neural interfacing. Here, this challenge is addressed by developing a soft, high-density, stretchable electrode grid based on an inert, high-performance composite material comprising gold-coated titanium dioxide nanowires embedded in a silicone matrix. The developed grid can resolve high spatiotemporal neural signals from the surface of the cortex in freely moving rats with stable neural recording quality and preserved electrode signal coherence during 3 months of implantation. Due to its flexible and stretchable nature, it is possible to minimize the size of the craniotomy required for placement, further reducing the level of invasiveness. The material and device technology presented herein have potential for a wide range of emerging biomedical applications.},

Transcranial electrical stimulation (TES), including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), has gained popularity because of its convenience and potential as a chronic therapy. However, a mechanistic understanding of TES has lagged behind its widespread adoption. Here, we review data and modelling on the immediate neurophysiological effects of TES in vitro as well as in vivo in both humans and other animals. While it remains unclear how typical TES protocols affect neural activity, we propose that validated models of current flow should inform study design and artifacts should be carefully excluded during signal recording and analysis. Potential indirect effects of TES (e.g., peripheral stimulation) should be investigated in more detail and further explored in experimental designs. We also consider how novel technologies may stimulate the next generation of TES experiments and devices, thus enhancing validity, specificity, and reproducibility.},

SPW-Rs are characterized by several spectral components: a slow (5-15 Hz) sharp-wave, a high-frequency "ripple" oscillation (150-200 Hz), and a slow "gamma" oscillation (20-40 Hz). Using laminar hippocampal recordings and optogenetic manipulations, we dissected the origin of these spectral components. We show that increased power in the 20-40 Hz band does not reflect an entrainment of CA1 and CA3 neurons at gamma frequency but the power envelope of overlapping ripples. Spike-local field potential coupling between unit firing in CA1 and CA3 regions during SPW-Rs is lowest in the gamma band. Longer SPW-Rs are preceded by increased firing in the entorhinal cortex. Thus, fusion of SPW-Rs leads to lengthening of their duration associated with increased power in the slow gamma band without the presence of true oscillation.},

Here we report that activity of HD neurons is influenced by the ambulatory constraints imposed upon the animal by the boundaries of the explored environment, leading to spurious spatial information. However, in the post-subiculum, the main cortical stage of HD signal processing, HD neurons convey true spatial information in the form of border modulated activity through the integration of additional sensory modalities relative to egocentric position, unlike their driving thalamic inputs. These findings demonstrate how the combination of HD and egocentric information can be transduced into a spatial code.},

To examine how neuronal firing patterns in the hippocampus are transmitted and transformed, we recorded neurons in its principal subcortical target, the lateral septum (LS). We observed that LS neurons carry reliable spatial information in the phase of action potentials, relative to hippocampal theta oscillations, while the firing rates of LS neurons remained uninformative. Furthermore, this spatial phase code had an anatomical microstructure within the LS and was bound to the hippocampal spatial code by synchronous gamma frequency cell assemblies. Using a data-driven model, we show that rate-independent spatial tuning arises through the dynamic weighting of CA1 and CA3 cell assemblies. Our findings demonstrate that transformation of the hippocampal spatial map depends on higher-order theta-dependent neuronal sequences. VIDEO ABSTRACT.},

  abstract        = {Excitatory control of inhibitory neurons is poorly understood due to the difficulty of studying synaptic connectivity in vivo. We inferred such connectivity through analysis of spike timing and validated this inference using juxtacellular and optogenetic control of presynaptic spikes in behaving mice. We observed that neighboring CA1 neurons had stronger connections and that superficial pyramidal cells projected more to deep interneurons. Connection probability and strength were skewed, with a minority of highly connected hubs. Divergent presynaptic connections led to synchrony between interneurons. Synchrony of convergent presynaptic inputs boosted postsynaptic drive. Presynaptic firing frequency was read out by postsynaptic neurons through short-term depression and facilitation, with individual pyramidal cells and interneurons displaying a diversity of spike transmission filters. Additionally, spike transmission was strongly modulated by prior spike timing of the postsynaptic cell. These results bridge anatomical structure with physiological function.},

All references to intensity given in mA in the manuscript refer to peak-to-peak amplitudes, except in Fig. 2, where the model is calibrated to 1 mA peak amplitude, as stated. In the original version of the paper we incorrectly calibrated the computational models to 1 mA peak-to-peak, rather than 1 mA peak amplitude. This means that we divided by a value twice as large as we should have. The correct estimated fields are therefore twice as large as shown in the original Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figure 11. The corrected figures are now properly calibrated to 1 mA peak amplitude. Furthermore, the sentence in the first paragraph of the Results section 'Intensity ranged from 0.5 to 2.5 mA (current density 0.125-0.625 mA mA/cm ), which is stronger than in previous reports', should have read 'Intensity ranged from 0.5 to 2.5 mA peak to peak (peak current density 0.0625-0.3125 mA/cm ), which is stronger than in previous reports.'

Here, we report that in rodents and human cadaver brains, ~75% of scalp-applied currents are attenuated by soft tissue and skull. Using intracellular and extracellular recordings in rats, we find that at least 1 mV/mm voltage gradient is necessary to affect neuronal spiking and subthreshold currents. We designed an 'intersectional short pulse' stimulation method to inject sufficiently high current intensities into the brain, while keeping the charge density and sensation on the scalp surface relatively low. We verify the regional specificity of this novel method in rodents; in humans, we demonstrate how it affects the amplitude of simultaneously recorded EEG alpha waves. Our combined results establish that neuronal circuits are instantaneously affected by intensity currents that are higher than those used in conventional protocols.},

There has been a growing interest in leveraging this vast volume of data across levels of analysis, measurement techniques, and experimental paradigms to gain more insight into brain function. Such efforts are visible at an international scale, with the emergence of big data neuroscience initiatives, such as the BRAIN initiative (Bargmann et al., 2014), the Human Brain Project, the Human Connectome Project, and the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria initiative. With these large-scale projects, much thought has been given to data-sharing across groups (Poldrack and Gorgolewski, 2014; Sejnowski et al., 2014); however, even with such data-sharing initiatives, funding mechanisms, and infrastructure, there still exists the challenge of how to cohesively integrate all the data. At multiple stages and levels of neuroscience investigation, machine learning holds great promise as an addition to the arsenal of analysis tools for discovering how the brain works.},

However, the mechanism by which this brain state can simultaneously implement the 'selective' plasticity needed to consolidate novel memory traces and the 'general' plasticity necessary to maintain a well-functioning neuronal system is unclear. Recent findings show that both of these functions differentially affect neurons based on their intrinsic firing rate, a ubiquitous neuronal heterogeneity. Furthermore, they are both implemented by the NREM slow oscillation, which also distinguishes neurons based on firing rate during sequential activity at the DOWN→UP transition. These findings suggest a mechanism by which spiking activity during the slow oscillation acts to maintain network statistics that promote a skewed distribution of neuronal firing rates, and perturbation of that activity by hippocampal replay acts to integrate new memory traces into the existing cortical network.},

We found coordinated reactivations between the hippocampus and the BLA during non-REM sleep following training. These reactivations peaked during hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs) and involved a subgroup of BLA cells positively modulated during hippocampal SPW-Rs. Notably, reactivation was stronger for the hippocampus-BLA correlation patterns representing the run direction that involved the air puff than for the 'safe' direction. These findings suggest that consolidation of contextual emotional memory occurs during ripple-reactivation of hippocampus-amygdala circuits.},

However, the mechanisms that give rise to these relationships are not well understood. Using high spatial resolution electrophysiology, we investigated the influence of CA3 and entorhinal inputs on the timing of CA1 neurons. The theta-phase preference and excitatory strength of the afferent CA3 and entorhinal inputs effectively timed the principal neuron activity, as well as regulated distinct CA1 interneuron populations in multiple tasks and behavioral states. Feedback potentiation of distal dendritic inhibition by CA1 place cells attenuated the excitatory entorhinal input at place field entry, coupled with feedback depression of proximal dendritic and perisomatic inhibition, allowing the CA3 input to gain control toward the exit. Thus, upstream inputs interact with local mechanisms to determine theta-phase timing of hippocampal neurons to support memory and spatial navigation.},

Previous reports argue that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can entrain and enhance neural rhythms related to memory, but the evidence from non-invasive recordings has remained inconclusive. Here, we measure endogenous spindle and theta activity intracranially in humans during low-frequency tACS and find no stable entrainment of spindle power during non-REM sleep, nor of theta power during resting wakefulness. As positive controls, we find robust entrainment of spindle activity to endogenous slow-wave activity in 66% of electrodes as well as entrainment to rhythmic noise-burst acoustic stimulation in 14% of electrodes. We conclude that low-frequency tACS at common stimulation intensities neither acutely modulates spindle activity during sleep nor theta activity during waking rest, likely because of the attenuated electrical fields reaching the cortical surface.},

Although spatial-temporal sequences of brain activity often correlate with distance and duration measures, these correlations may not correspond to neuronal representations of space or time.

Although experimental evidence supports the role of sharp-wave ripples in transferring hippocampal information to the neocortex, the exact cortical destinations and the physiological mechanisms of such transfer are not known. We used a conducting polymer-based conformable microelectrode array (NeuroGrid) to record local field potentials and neural spiking across the dorsal cortical surface of the rat brain, combined with silicon probe recordings in the hippocampus, to identify candidate physiological patterns. Parietal, midline, and prefrontal, but not primary cortical areas, displayed localized ripple (100 to 150 hertz) oscillations during sleep, concurrent with hippocampal ripples. Coupling between hippocampal and neocortical ripples was strengthened during sleep following learning. These findings suggest that ripple-ripple coupling supports hippocampal-association cortical transfer of memory traces.},

  abstract        = {It is well-established that the feed-forward connected main hippocampal areas, CA3, CA2, and CA1 work cooperatively during spatial navigation and memory. These areas are similar in terms of the prevalent types of neurons; however, they display different spatial coding and oscillatory dynamics. Understanding the temporal dynamics of these operations requires simultaneous recordings from these regions. However, simultaneous recordings from multiple regions and subregions in behaving animals have become possible only recently. We performed large-scale silicon probe recordings simultaneously spanning across all layers of CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions in rats during spatial navigation and sleep and compared their behavior-dependent spiking, oscillatory dynamics and functional connectivity. The accuracy of place cell spatial coding increased progressively from distal to proximal CA1, suddenly dropped in CA2, and increased again from CA3a toward CA3c. These variations can be attributed in part to the different entorhinal inputs to each subregions, and the differences in theta modulation of CA1, CA2, and CA3 neurons. We also found that neurons in the subregions showed differences in theta modulation, phase precession, state-dependent changes in firing rates and functional connectivity among neurons of these regions. Our results indicate that a combination of intrinsic properties together with distinct intra- and extra-hippocampal inputs may account for the subregion-specific modulation of spiking dynamics and spatial tuning of neurons during behavior. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Mice learned new sets of three goal locations daily in a multiwell maze. We used closed-loop SPW-R detection at goal locations to trigger optogenetic silencing of a subset of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Control place cells (nonsilenced or silenced outside SPW-Rs) largely maintained the location of their place fields after learning and showed increased spatial information content. In contrast, the place fields of SPW-R-silenced place cells remapped, and their spatial information remained unaltered. SPW-R silencing did not impact the firing rates or proportions of place cells. These results suggest that interference with SPW-R-associated activity during learning prevents stabilization and refinement of hippocampal maps.},

However, the mechanism of their generation remains unclear. Using two-dimensional silicon probe arrays, we investigated the propagation of SPW-Rs across the hippocampal CA1, CA2, and CA3 subregions. Synchronous activation of CA2 ensembles preceded SPW-R-related population activity in CA3 and CA1 regions. Deep CA2 neurons gradually increased their activity prior to ripples and were suppressed during the population bursts of CA3-CA1 neurons (ramping cells). Activity of superficial CA2 cells preceded the activity surge in CA3-CA1 (phasic cells). The trigger role of the CA2 region in SPW-R was more pronounced during waking than sleeping. These results point to the CA2 region as an initiation zone for SPW-Rs.},

Physiological support for such function has been hampered by a lack of well-defined characteristics that can identify granule cells and mossy cells. We developed an electrophysiology-based classification of dentate granule cells and mossy cells in mice that we validated by optogenetic tagging of mossy cells. Granule cells exhibited sparse firing, had a single place field, and showed only modest changes when the mouse was tested in different mazes in the same room. In contrast, mossy cells were more active, had multiple place fields and showed stronger remapping of place fields under the same conditions. Although the granule cell-mossy cell synapse was strong and facilitating, mossy cells rarely "inherited" place fields from single granule cells. Our findings suggest that the granule cells and mossy cells could be modulated separately and their joint action may be critical for pattern separation.},

We used large-scale recordings to examine the activity of neurons in the frontal cortex of rats and first observed that the distribution of pyramidal cell firing rates was wide and strongly skewed toward high firing rates. Moreover, neurons from different parts of that distribution were differentially modulated by sleep substates. Periods of nonREM sleep reduced the activity of high firing rate neurons and tended to upregulate firing of slow-firing neurons. By contrast, the effect of REM was to reduce firing rates across the entire rate spectrum. Microarousals, interspersed within nonREM epochs, increased firing rates of slow-firing neurons. The net result of sleep was to homogenize the firing rate distribution. These findings are at variance with current homeostatic models and provide a novel view of sleep in adjusting network excitability.},

Slow-firing cells, rather than fast-firing cells, gained high place specificity during exploration, elevated their association with ripples, and showed increased bursting and temporal coactivation during postexperience sleep. Thus, slow- and fast-firing neurons, although forming a continuous distribution, have different coding and plastic properties.},

Here, we present the first fiber-less optoelectrode with a monolithically integrated optical waveguide mixer that can deliver multicolor light at a common waveguide port to achieve multicolor modulation of the same neuronal population in vivo. We demonstrate successful device implementation by achieving efficient coupling between a side-emitting injection laser diode (ILD) and a dielectric optical waveguide mixer via a gradient-index (GRIN) lens. The use of GRIN lenses attains several design features, including high optical coupling and thermal isolation between ILDs and waveguides. We validated the packaged devices in the intact brain of anesthetized mice co-expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 and Archaerhodopsin in pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 region, achieving high quality recording, activation and silencing of the exact same neurons in a given local region. This fully-integrated approach demonstrates the spatial precision and scalability needed to enable independent activation and silencing of the same or different groups of neurons in dense brain regions while simultaneously recording from them, thus considerably advancing the capabilities of currently available optogenetic toolsets.},

  abstract        = {We describe a technique to semichronically record the cortical extracellular neural activity in the behaving monkey employing commercial high-density electrodes. After the design and construction of low cost microdrives that allow varying the depth of the recording locations after the implantation surgery, we recorded the extracellular unit activity from pools of neurons at different depths in the presupplementary motor cortex (pre-SMA) of a rhesus monkey trained in a tapping task. The collected data were processed to classify cells as putative pyramidal cells or interneurons on the basis of their waveform features. We also demonstrate that short time cross-correlogram occasionally yields unit pairs with high short latency (<5 ms), narrow bin (<3 ms) peaks, indicative of monosynaptic spike transmission from pre- to postsynaptic neurons. These methods have been verified extensively in rodents. Finally, we observed that the pattern of population activity was repetitive over distinct trials of the tapping task. These results show that the semichronic technique is a viable option for the large-scale parallel recording of local circuit activity at different depths in the cortex of the macaque monkey and other large species.},

  abstract     = {In memory, the continuous flow of experience is punctuated at meaningful boundaries between one episode and the next. When salient events are separated by increasing amounts of space or time, memory systems can accommodate in two ways. One option is to increase the amount of neural resources devoted to longer event segments. The other is to maintain the same neural resources with sacrificed spatiotemporal resolution. Here we review how the spatial coding system is affected by the segmentation of space by goals and boundaries. We argue that the resolution of the place code is dictated by the amount of space encoded within periods of theta. Thus, the theta cycle is viewed as a ‘neural word’ that segregates segments of space and its cognitive equivalents (memory, planning). In support of this conclusion, we report that, as rats traverse a linear track, the beginning of a journey is represented at the falling phase of theta whereas the journey’s end is represented on the ascending phase. The current location is represented in the temporal context of the past and future event boundaries. These results are discussed in relation to the changes in physiology observed across the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus, with a special consideration for how sequence information could be integrated by downstream ‘reader’ neurons.},

It offers a theoretical treatment that tries to make sense of the architectural principles seen in mammalian brains. Specifically, it considers a factorisation between representations of temporal succession and representations of content or, heuristically, a segregation into when and what. This segregation may explain the central role of the hippocampus in neuronal hierarchies while providing a tentative explanation for recent observations of how ordinal sequences are encoded. The implications for neuroanatomy and physiology may have something important to say about how self-organised cell assembly sequences enable the brain to exhibit purposeful behaviour that transcends the here and now.},

We fabricated and implanted the four-shank probes, each integrated with 12 μLEDs and 32 recording sites, into the CA1 pyramidal layer of anesthetized and freely moving mice. Spikes were robustly induced by 60 nW light power, and fast population oscillations were induced at the microwatt range. To demonstrate the spatiotemporal precision of parallel stimulation and recording, we achieved independent control of distinct cells ∼ 50 μm apart and of differential somato-dendritic compartments of single neurons. The scalability and spatiotemporal resolution of this monolithic optogenetic tool provides versatility and precision for cellular-level circuit analysis in deep structures of intact, freely moving animals.},

Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) identify epileptic brain regions and can impair memory, but the mechanisms by which they interact with physiological patterns of network activity are mostly undefined. We show in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy that spontaneous hippocampal IEDs correlate with impaired memory consolidation, and that they are precisely coordinated with spindle oscillations in the prefrontal cortex during nonrapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep. This coordination surpasses the normal physiological ripple-spindle coupling and is accompanied by decreased ripple occurrence. IEDs also induce spindles during rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep and wakefulness-behavioral states that do not naturally express these oscillations-by generating a cortical 'down' state. In a pilot clinical examination of four subjects with focal epilepsy, we confirm a similar correlation of temporofrontal IEDs with spindles over anatomically restricted cortical regions. These findings imply that IEDs may impair memory via the misappropriation of physiological mechanisms for hippocampal-cortical coupling, which suggests a target for the treatment of memory impairment in epilepsy.},

  abstract        = {Sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) represent the most synchronous population pattern in the mammalian brain. Their excitatory output affects a wide area of the cortex and several subcortical nuclei. SPW-Rs occur during "off-line" states of the brain, associated with consummatory behaviors and non-REM sleep, and are influenced by numerous neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. They arise from the excitatory recurrent system of the CA3 region and the SPW-induced excitation brings about a fast network oscillation (ripple) in CA1. The spike content of SPW-Rs is temporally and spatially coordinated by a consortium of interneurons to replay fragments of waking neuronal sequences in a compressed format. SPW-Rs assist in transferring this compressed hippocampal representation to distributed circuits to support memory consolidation; selective disruption of SPW-Rs interferes with memory. Recently acquired and pre-existing information are combined during SPW-R replay to influence decisions, plan actions and, potentially, allow for creative thoughts. In addition to the widely studied contribution to memory, SPW-Rs may also affect endocrine function via activation of hypothalamic circuits. Alteration of the physiological mechanisms supporting SPW-Rs leads to their pathological conversion, "p-ripples," which are a marker of epileptogenic tissue and can be observed in rodent models of schizophrenia and Alzheimer's Disease. Mechanisms for SPW-R genesis and function are discussed in this review.},

We report that PV+ interneurons employ a novel CaMK-dependent pathway to trigger CREB phosphorylation and gene expression. As in excitatory neurons, voltage-gated Ca(2+) influx through CaV1 channels triggers CaM nuclear translocation via local Ca(2+) signaling. However, PV+ interneurons are distinct in that nuclear signaling is mediated by γCaMKI, not γCaMKII. CREB phosphorylation also proceeds with slow, sigmoid kinetics, rate-limited by paucity of CaMKIV, protecting against saturation of phospho-CREB in the face of higher firing rates and bigger Ca(2+) transients. Our findings support the generality of CaM shuttling to drive nuclear CaMK activity, and they are relevant to disease pathophysiology, insofar as dysfunction of PV+ interneurons and molecules underpinning their excitation-transcription coupling both relate to neuropsychiatric disease.},

Firing rates and rate modulations of individual neurons, and multineuronal sequences of pyramidal cell and interneuron spiking, were correlated during theta oscillations, spontaneous ripples, and synthetic ripples. Interneuron spiking was crucial for sequence consistency.

In contrast, closed-loop systems provide intervention only when needed by detecting abnormal neurological signals and modulating them with instantaneous feedback. Closed-loop systems have been applied to several neurological conditions (most notably epilepsy and movement disorders), but widespread use is limited by conceptual and technical challenges.

Here, we address this challenge by developing an organic material-based, ultraconformable, biocompatible and scalable neural interface array (the 'NeuroGrid') that can record both local field potentials(LFPs) and action potentials from superficial cortical neurons without penetrating the brain surface. Spikes with features of interneurons and pyramidal cells were simultaneously acquired by multiple neighboring electrodes of the NeuroGrid, allowing for the isolation of putative single neurons in rats. Spiking activity demonstrated consistent phase modulation by ongoing brain oscillations and was stable in recordings exceeding 1 week's duration. We also recorded LFP-modulated spiking activity intraoperatively in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery. The NeuroGrid constitutes an effective method for large-scale, stable recording of neuronal spikes in concert with local population synaptic activity, enhancing comprehension of neural processes across spatiotemporal scales and potentially facilitating diagnosis and therapy for brain disorders.},

We recently introduced CaMPARI, an engineered fluorescent protein whose green-to-red photoconversion depends on simultaneous light exposure and elevated calcium, which enabled marking active neuronal populations with single-cell and subsecond resolution. However, CaMPARI (CaMPARI1) has several drawbacks, including background photoconversion in low calcium, slow kinetics and reduced fluorescence after chemical fixation. In this work, we develop CaMPARI2, an improved sensor with brighter green and red fluorescence, faster calcium unbinding kinetics and decreased photoconversion in low calcium conditions. We demonstrate the improved performance of CaMPARI2 in mammalian neurons and in vivo in larval zebrafish brain and mouse visual cortex. Additionally, we herein develop an immunohistochemical detection method for specific labeling of the photoconverted red form of CaMPARI. The anti-CaMPARI-red antibody provides strong labeling that is selective for photoconverted CaMPARI in activated neurons in rodent brain tissue.},

This has largely been ascribed to long-term depression (LTD) at thalamocortical synapses, while a contribution from intracortical inhibition has been controversial. Here we used optogenetics to isolate and measure feedforward thalamocortical and feedback intracortical excitation-inhibition (E-I) ratios following brief MD. Despite depression at thalamocortical synapses, thalamocortical E-I ratio was unaffected in V1b and shifted toward excitation in V1m, indicating that thalamocortical excitation was not effectively reduced. In contrast, feedback intracortical E-I ratio was shifted toward inhibition in V1m, and a computational model demonstrated that these opposing shifts produced an overall suppression of layer 4 excitability. Thus, feedforward and feedback E-I ratios can be independently tuned by visual experience, and enhanced feedback inhibition is the primary driving force behind loss of visual responsiveness.},

  abstract        = {Neocortical circuits use a family of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms to stabilize firing, including excitatory and inhibitory synaptic scaling and homeostatic intrinsic plasticity (Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004). All three mechanisms can be induced in tandem in cultured rat neocortical pyramidal neurons by chronic manipulations of firing, but it is unknown whether they are coinduced by the same activity-sensors and signaling pathways, or whether they are under independent control. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV (CaMKIV) is a key sensory/effector in excitatory synaptic scaling that senses perturbations in firing through changes in calcium influx, and translates this into compensatory changes in excitatory quantal amplitude (Ibata et al., 2008; Goold and Nicoll, 2010). Whether CaMKIV also controls inhibitory synaptic scaling and intrinsic homeostatic plasticity was unknown. To test this we manipulated CaMKIV signaling in individual neurons using dominant-negative (dn) or constitutively-active (ca) forms of nuclear-localized CaMKIV and measured the induction of all three forms of homeostatic plasticity. We found that excitatory synaptic scaling and intrinsic plasticity were bidirectionally coinduced by these manipulations. In contrast, these cell-autonomous manipulations had no impact on inhibitory quantal amplitude. Finally, we found that spontaneous firing rates were shifted up or down by dnCaMKIV or caCaMKIV, respectively, suggesting that uncoupling CaMKIV activation from activity generates an error signal in the negative feedback mechanism that controls firing rates. Together, our data show that excitatory synaptic scaling and intrinsic excitability are tightly coordinated through bidirectional changes in the same signaling pathway, whereas inhibitory synaptic scaling is sensed and regulated through an independent control mechanism.  Maintaining stable function in highly interconnected neural circuits is essential for preventing circuit disorders, and is accomplished through a set of negative feedback mechanisms that sense and compensate for perturbations in activity. These "homeostatic" mechanisms can target synaptic excitation, synaptic inhibition, and intrinsic excitability, but whether they are independently controlled is not known. We find that synaptic excitation and intrinsic excitability are coregulated in individual neurons through CaMKIV signaling, which is tightly controlled by neuronal activity. In contrast, synaptic inhibition is unaffected by changes in firing or CaMKIV signaling in individual neurons. These results show that circuit stability is controlled both through cell-autonomous mechanisms that regulate some aspects of excitability, as well as circuit-level mechanisms that adjust inhibition.},

  abstract        = {Superresolution microscopy has fundamentally altered our ability to resolve subcellular proteins, but improving on these techniques to study dense structures composed of single-molecule-sized elements has been a challenge. One possible approach to enhance superresolution precision is to use cryogenic fluorescent imaging, reported to reduce fluorescent protein bleaching rates, thereby increasing the precision of superresolution imaging. Here, we describe an approach to cryogenic photoactivated localization microscopy (cPALM) that permits the use of a room-temperature high-numerical-aperture objective lens to image frozen samples in their native state. We find that cPALM increases photon yields and show that this approach can be used to enhance the effective resolution of two photoactivatable/switchable fluorophore-labeled structures in the same frozen sample. This higher resolution, two-color extension of the cPALM technique will expand the accessibility of this approach to a range of laboratories interested in more precise reconstructions of complex subcellular targets.},

To uncover the pathways involved, we performed a cell-type-specific screen for transcripts persistently altered during scaling, which identified the μ subunit (μ3A) of the adaptor protein complex AP-3A. Synaptic scaling increased μ3A (but not other AP-3 subunits) in pyramidal neurons and redistributed dendritic μ3A and AMPAR to recycling endosomes (REs). Knockdown of μ3A prevented synaptic scaling and this redistribution, while overexpression (OE) of full-length μ3A or a truncated μ3A that cannot interact with the AP-3A complex was sufficient to drive AMPAR to REs. Finally, OE of μ3A acted synergistically with GRIP1 to recruit AMPAR to the dendritic membrane. These data suggest that excess μ3A acts independently of the AP-3A complex to reroute AMPAR to RE, generating a reservoir of receptors essential for the regulated recruitment to the synaptic membrane during scaling up.},

When neuronal firing rates were perturbed by visual deprivation, they gradually returned to a precise, cell-autonomous set point during periods of active wake, with lengthening of the wake period enhancing firing rate rebound. Unexpectedly, this resetting of neuronal firing was suppressed during sleep. This raises the possibility that memory consolidation or other sleep-dependent processes are vulnerable to interference from homeostatic plasticity mechanisms. PAPERCLIP.},

Scaling up in response to action-potential blockade is accomplished through increased synaptic accumulation of GluA2-containing AMPA receptors (AMPAR), but the receptor trafficking steps that drive this process remain largely obscure. Here, we show that the AMPAR-binding protein glutamate receptor-interacting protein-1 (GRIP1) is essential for regulated synaptic AMPAR accumulation during scaling up. Synaptic abundance of GRIP1 was enhanced by activity deprivation, directly increasing synaptic GRIP1 abundance through overexpression increased the amplitude of AMPA miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), and shRNA-mediated GRIP1 knockdown prevented scaling up of AMPA mEPSCs. Furthermore, knockdown and replace experiments targeting either GRIP1 or GluA2 revealed that scaling up requires the interaction between GRIP1 and GluA2. Finally, GRIP1 synaptic accumulation during scaling up did not require GluA2 binding. Taken together, our data support a model in which activity-dependent trafficking of GRIP1 to synaptic sites drives the forward trafficking and enhanced synaptic accumulation of GluA2-containing AMPAR during synaptic scaling up.},

  abstract        = {Inhibition from fast-spiking (FS) interneurons plays a crucial role in shaping cortical response properties and gating developmental periods of activity-dependent plasticity, yet the expression mechanisms underlying FS inhibitory plasticity remain largely unexplored. In layer 4 of visual cortex (V1), monocular deprivation (MD) induces either depression or potentiation of FS to star pyramidal neuron (FS→SP) synapses, depending on the age of onset (Maffei et al., 2004, 2006). This reversal in the sign (- to +) of plasticity occurs on the cusp of the canonical critical period (CP). To investigate the expression locus behind this switch in sign of inhibitory plasticity, mice underwent MD during the pre-CP [eye-opening to postnatal day (p)17] or CP (p22-p25), and FS→SP synaptic strength within layer 4 was assessed using confocal and immunoelectron microscopy, as well as optogenetic activation of FS cells to probe quantal amplitude at FS→SP synapses. Brief MD before p17 or p25 did not alter the density of FS→SP contacts. However, at the ultrastructural level, FS→SP synapses in deprived hemispheres during the CP, but not the pre-CP or in GAD65 knock-out mice, had larger synapses and increased docked vesicle density compared with synapses from the nondeprived control hemispheres. Moreover, FS→SP evoked miniature IPSCs increased in deprived hemispheres when MD was initiated during the CP, accompanied by an increase in the density of postsynaptic GABAA receptors at FS→SP synapses. These coordinated changes in FS→SP synaptic strength define an expression pathway modulating excitatory output during CP plasticity in visual cortex.},

Here, we use simultaneous time-lapse imaging of post synaptic density-95 (PSD-95) and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) to investigate the dynamics of protein composition at axodendritic (AD) contacts. Our data reveal that this composition is highly dynamic, with both proteins moving into and out of the same synapse independently, so that synapses cycle rapidly between states in which they are enriched for none, one or both proteins. We assessed how PSD-95 and CaMKII interact at stable and transient AD sites and found that both phospho-CaMKII and PSD-95 are present more often at stable than labile contacts. Finally, we found that synaptic contacts are more stable in older neurons, and this process can be mimicked in younger neurons by overexpression of PSD-95. Taken together, these data show that synaptic protein composition is highly variable over a time-scale of hours, and that PSD-95 is probably a key synaptic protein that promotes synapse stability.},

In visual cortex the effects of visual deprivation change dramatically at the transition from the pre-CP to the CP, but the cellular plasticity mechanisms that underlie this change are poorly understood. Here we show that plasticity at unitary connections between GABAergic Fast Spiking (FS) cells and Star Pyramidal (SP) neurons within layer 4 flips sign at the transition between the pre-CP and the CP. During the pre-CP, coupling FS firing with SP depolarization induces long-term depression of inhibition at this synapse, whereas the same protocol induces long-term potentiation of inhibition at the opening of the CP. Despite being of opposite sign, both forms of plasticity share expression characteristics--a change in coefficient of variation with no change in paired-pulse ratio--and depend on GABAB receptor signaling. Finally, we show that the reciprocal SP → FS synapse also acquires the ability to undergo long-term potentiation at the pre-CP to CP transition. Thus, at the opening of the CP, there are coordinated changes in plasticity that allow specific patterns of activity within layer 4 to potentiate feedback inhibition by boosting the strength of FS ↔ SP connections.},

  abstract        = {A key neuronal mechanism for adjusting excitatory synaptic strength is clathrin-mediated endocytosis of postsynaptic glutamate receptors (GluRs). The actin cytoskeleton is critical for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, yet we lack a mechanistic understanding of its interaction with the endocytic process and how it may be regulated. Here we show that F-actin in dendritic spines physically binds the synaptic nuclear envelope 1 gene product candidate plasticity gene 2 (CPG2) in a PKA-dependent manner, and that this association is required for synaptic GluR internalization. Mutating two PKA sites on CPG2 disrupts its cytoskeletal association, attenuating GluR endocytosis and affecting the efficacy of synaptic transmission in vivo. These results identify CPG2 as an F-actin binding partner that functionally mediates interaction of the spine cytoskeleton with postsynaptic endocytosis. Further, the regulation of CPG2/F-actin association by PKA provides a gateway for cellular control of synaptic receptor internalization through second messenger signaling pathways. Recent identification of human synaptic nuclear envelope 1 as a risk locus for bipolar disorder suggests that CPG2 could play a role in synaptic dysfunction underlying neuropsychiatric disease.},

  abstract        = {Synaptic scaling is a form of synaptic plasticity that contributes to the homeostatic regulation of neuronal activity both in vitro and in vivo, by bidirectionally and proportionally adjusting postsynaptic AMPA receptor (AMPAR) abundance to compensate for chronic perturbations in activity. This proportional regulation of synaptic strength allows synaptic scaling to normalize activity without disrupting the synapse-specific differences in strength thought to underlie memory storage, but how such proportional scaling of synaptic strength is accomplished at the biophysical level is unknown. Here we addressed this question in cultured rat visual cortical pyramidal neurons. We used photoactivation and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of fluorescently tagged AMPAR to show that scaling down, but not up, decreases the steady-state accumulation of synaptic AMPAR by increasing the rate at which they unbind from and exit the postsynaptic density (Koff). This increase in Koff was not diffusion limited, was independent of AMPAR endocytosis, and was prevented by a scaffold manipulation that specifically blocks scaling down, suggesting that it is accomplished through enhanced dissociation of AMPAR from synaptic scaffold tethers. Finally, simulations show that increasing Koff decreases synaptic strength multiplicatively, by reducing the fractional occupancy of available scaffold "slots." These data demonstrate that scaling down is accomplished through a regulated increase in Koff, which in turn reduces the fractional occupancy of synaptic scaffolds to proportionally reduce synaptic strength.},

  abstract        = {Visual deprivation profoundly affects visual cortical response properties, but the activity-dependent plasticity mechanisms that underlie these changes are poorly understood. Monocular deprivation (MD) induces ocular dominance (OD) shifts through biphasic changes in cortical excitability, first decreasing responsiveness to the deprived eye, and then slowly increasing responsiveness to both the deprived and spared eyes. It has been suggested that this slow gain of responsiveness is due to homeostatic synaptic scaling, but this prediction has not been tested directly. Here we show that, in rat monocular and binocular primary visual cortex (V1m and V1b), postsynaptic strength onto layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons is modulated in a biphasic manner by MD, first undergoing a net decrease after 1 and 2 d MD, increasing back to baseline after 3 d, and finally undergoing a net potentiation between 3 and 6 d. The time course and direction of these synaptic changes match well the known changes in visual responsiveness during OD plasticity. Viral-mediated delivery of the GluA2 C-tail in vivo blocked these synaptic changes, indicating that, like synaptic scaling in vitro, AMPA receptor trafficking via the GluA2 C-tail is required for the delayed increase in postsynaptic strength. Finally, we also observed a delayed increase in the intrinsic excitability of L2/3 pyramidal neurons following prolonged MD. These data indicate that synaptic and intrinsic homeostatic mechanisms cooperate to increase excitability of L2/3 pyramidal neurons following prolonged MD, and suggest that these homeostatic mechanisms contribute to the delayed gain of visual responsiveness during OD plasticity.},

  abstract        = {Neuroscience is at a crossroads. Great effort is being invested into deciphering specific neural interactions and circuits. At the same time, there exist few general theories or principles that explain brain function. We attribute this disparity, in part, to limitations in current methodologies. Traditional neurophysiological approaches record the activities of one neuron or a few neurons at a time. Neurochemical approaches focus on single neurotransmitters. Yet, there is an increasing realization that neural circuits operate at emergent levels, where the interactions between hundreds or thousands of neurons, utilizing multiple chemical transmitters, generate functional states. Brains function at the nanoscale, so tools to study brains must ultimately operate at this scale, as well. Nanoscience and nanotechnology are poised to provide a rich toolkit of novel methods to explore brain function by enabling simultaneous measurement and manipulation of activity of thousands or even millions of neurons. We and others refer to this goal as the Brain Activity Mapping Project. In this Nano Focus, we discuss how recent developments in nanoscale analysis tools and in the design and synthesis of nanomaterials have generated optical, electrical, and chemical methods that can readily be adapted for use in neuroscience. These approaches represent exciting areas of technical development and research. Moreover, unique opportunities exist for nanoscientists, nanotechnologists, and other physical scientists and engineers to contribute to tackling the challenging problems involved in understanding the fundamentals of brain function.},

Most cases of Rett are caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene coding for the transcriptional regulator methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), but despite much effort, it remains unclear how a loss of MeCP2 function generates the neurological deficits of Rett. Here we show that MeCP2 plays an essential and cell-autonomous role in homeostatic synaptic scaling up in response to reduced firing or reduced sensory drive in rat visual cortical pyramidal neurons. We found that acute RNAi knockdown of MeCP2 blocked synaptic scaling within targeted neocortical pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, MeCP2 knockdown decreased excitatory synapse number without affecting basal mEPSC amplitude or AMPAR accumulation at spared synapses, demonstrating that MeCP2 acts cell-autonomously to maintain both excitatory synapse number and synaptic scaling in individual neocortical neurons. Finally, we used a mouse model of Rett to show that MeCP2 loss prevents homeostatic synaptic scaling up in response to visual deprivation in vivo, demonstrating for the first time that MeCP2 loss disrupts homeostatic plasticity within the intact developing neocortex. Our results establish MeCP2 as a critical mediator of synaptic scaling and raise the possibility that some of the neurological defects of Rett arise from a disruption of homeostatic plasticity.},

  abstract        = {Different neocortical regions are functionally specialized, but whether this specialization is reflected in the forms of plasticity present during developmental critical periods (CPs) is largely unknown. In rodent visual cortex, we recently showed that a form of intrinsic plasticity [LTP of intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE)] in the monocular region of the primary visual cortex (V1M) plays an important role in modulating cortical responsiveness following visual deprivation. Here we ask whether LTP-IE is present and similarly regulated by visual experience in the binocular region of the primary visual cortex (V1B), where inputs from the two eyes compete during the CP. In contrast to V1M, where LTP-IE is present throughout the CP, in V1B LTP-IE was only transiently expressed at the onset of the CP. Also distinct from V1M, brief monocular deprivation (MD) was unable to modulate LTP-IE magnitude in V1B, and even binocular deprivation (the equivalent of MD in V1M) could only influence LTP-IE expression during a narrow time window at the peak of the CP. Finally, we asked whether these differences depend on differences in sensory activation of the two areas during development. MD of ipsilateral inputs from before eye opening (to reduce competitive interactions) did not affect the pattern of LTP-IE expression in V1B. Further, the differences in plasticity in the two cortical areas persisted when animals were reared in the dark to remove all patterned visual input. Thus neocortical LTP-IE expression shows dramatic regional and temporal differentiation, and these differences are not driven by differences in sensory experience.},

Recent work has shown that these destabilizing influences are counterbalanced by homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that act to stabilize neuronal and circuit activity. One such mechanism is synaptic scaling, which allows neurons to detect changes in their own firing rates through a set of calcium-dependent sensors that then regulate receptor trafficking to increase or decrease the accumulation of glutamate receptors at synaptic sites. Additional homeostatic mechanisms may allow local changes in synaptic activation to generate local synaptic adaptations, and network-wide changes in activity to generate network-wide adjustments in the balance between excitation and inhibition. The signaling pathways underlying these various forms of homeostatic plasticity are currently under intense scrutiny, and although dozens of molecular pathways have now been implicated in homeostatic plasticity, a clear picture of how homeostatic feedback is structured at the molecular level has not yet emerged. On a functional level, neuronal networks likely use this complex set of regulatory mechanisms to achieve homeostasis over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales.},

Furthermore, it remains unclear to what extent scaling up and scaling down use distinct molecular machinery. PSD-95 is a scaffold protein proposed to serve as a binding "slot" that determines synaptic AMPAR content, and synaptic PSD-95 abundance is regulated by activity, raising the possibility that activity-dependent changes in the synaptic abundance of PSD-95 or other membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) drives the bidirectional changes in AMPAR accumulation during synaptic scaling. We found that synaptic PSD-95 and SAP102 (but not PSD-93) abundance were bidirectionally regulated by activity, but these changes were not sufficient to drive homeostatic changes in synaptic strength. Although not sufficient, the PSD-95 MAGUKs were necessary for synaptic scaling, but scaling up and down were differentially dependent on PSD-95 and PSD-93. Scaling down was completely blocked by reduced or enhanced PSD-95, through a mechanism that depended on the PDZ1/2 domains. In contrast, scaling up could be supported by either PSD-95 or PSD-93 in a manner that depended on neuronal age and was unaffected by a superabundance of PSD-95. Together, our data suggest that scaling up and down of quantal amplitude is not driven by changes in synaptic abundance of PSD-95 MAGUKs, but rather that the PSD-95 MAGUKs serve as critical synaptic organizers that use distinct protein-protein interactions to mediate homeostatic accumulation and loss of synaptic AMPAR.},

This balance is thought to be maintained by an array of homeostatic mechanisms that regulate neuronal and circuit excitability, including mechanisms that target excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and mechanisms that target intrinsic neuronal excitability. In this review, I discuss where and when these mechanisms are used in complex microcircuits, what is currently known about the signaling pathways that underlie them, and how these different ways of achieving network stability cooperate and/or compete. An important challenge for the field of homeostatic plasticity is to assemble our understanding of these individual mechanisms into a coherent view of how microcircuit stability is maintained during experience-dependent circuit refinement.},

Here we show that MD reduces the intrinsic excitability of layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons and enhances long-term potentiation of intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE). Further, MD and LTP-IE induce reciprocal changes in K(v)2.1 current, and LTP-IE reverses the effects of MD on intrinsic excitability. Taken together these data suggest that MD reduces intrinsic excitability by preventing sensory-drive induced LTP-IE. The effects of MD on excitability were correlated with the classical visual system CP, and (like the functional effects of MD) could be rapidly reversed when vision was restored. These data establish LTP-IE as a candidate mechanism mediating loss of visual responsiveness within L5, and suggest that intrinsic plasticity plays an important role in experience-dependent refinement of visual cortical circuits.},

Here we show in rat cortical neurons that the effects of TNFα and activity blockade are not additive; whereas TNFα increased AMPA quantal amplitude at control synapses, TNFα reduced quantal amplitude at prescaled synapses, demonstrating state-dependent effects of TNFα signaling on the scaling process. Whereas synaptic scaling during prolonged activity blockade [24 h tetrodotoxin (TTX)] was prevented by blocking TNFα signaling, early scaling (6 h TTX) was not, unless TNFα signaling was first blocked for 24 h. Moreover, when synapses were prescaled, prolonged (24 h) but not brief (6 h) blockade of TNFα signaling reversed scaling. Finally, prolonged block of TNFα signaling modified the synaptic localization of several scaffold proteins, suggesting that maintenance of postsynaptic density composition is TNFα dependent. Together, these data suggest that TNFα is not an instructive signal for scaling but rather is critical for maintaining synapses in a plastic state in which synaptic scaling can be expressed.},

  abstract        = {Postnatal cortical circuit development is characterized by windows of heightened plasticity that contribute to the acquisition of mature connectivity and function. What drives the transition between different critical plasticity windows is not known. Here we show that a switch in sign of inhibitory plasticity correlates with the reported transition between the precritical period (pre-CP) and the critical period (CP) for ocular dominance plasticity (ODP). In layer 4 of binocular visual cortex (V1b), depression of inhibitory synapses onto pyramidal neurons is induced when rats are monocularly deprived for 2 d at the end of the third postnatal week (pre-CP), whereas potentiation is induced if the monocular deprivation is started in the fourth postnatal week (CP). The magnitude of potentiation increases with deprivations started close to the peak of the CP for ODP. The direction of inhibitory plasticity depends on the differential manipulation of circuits activated by the two eyes. During development, these two forms of plasticity shift the balance between excitation and inhibition of the circuit in opposite directions, whereas the excitatory synaptic drive remains unaffected. Inhibitory plasticity is thus fundamental in modulating cortical circuit refinement and might be one of the mechanisms promoting ocular dominance shifts.},

Both arise through changes in the synaptic accumulation of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), but whether they use similar or distinct receptor-trafficking pathways is unknown. Here, we show that TTX-induced synaptic scaling in cultured visual cortical neurons leads to the insertion of GluR2-containing AMPARs at synapses. Similarly, visual deprivation with monocular TTX injections results in synaptic accumulation of GluR2-containing AMPARs. Unlike chemical LTP, synaptic scaling is blocked by a GluR2 C-tail peptide but not by a GluR1 C-tail peptide. Knockdown of endogenous GluR2 with an short hairpin RNA (shRNA) also blocks synaptic scaling but not chemical LTP. Scaling can be rescued with expression of exogenous GluR2 resistant to the shRNA, but a chimeric GluR2 subunit with the C-terminal domain swapped with the GluR1 C-terminal domain (GluR2/CT1) does not rescue synaptic scaling, indicating that regulatory sequences on the GluR2 C-tail are required for the accumulation of synaptic AMPARs during scaling. Together, our results suggest that synaptic scaling and LTP use different trafficking pathways, making these two forms of plasticity both functionally and molecularly distinct.},

  abstract        = {Within primary visual cortex (V1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling through its high-affinity receptor TrkB is important for normal development and experience-dependent plasticity. TrkB is expressed in several alternatively spliced isoforms, including full-length TrkB (TrkB.FL), and several truncated isoforms (TrkB.T1, TrkB.T2, and TrkB.T4) that lack the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. These isoforms are important components of BDNF signaling, yet little is known about the developmental or experience-dependent regulation of their expression. Using immunohistochemistry, we found TrkB.FL and TrkB.T1 expressed in interneurons and pyramidal neurons within V1, but not in cortical astrocytes. We used real-time PCR to quantify the changes in mRNA expression of BDNF, the four TrkB isoforms, and the low-affinity receptor P75NTR during normal development, and in response to visual deprivation at two different ages. BDNF expression increased between postnatal days 10 (P10) and P30, and was rapidly down-regulated by 3 days of visual deprivation during both the pre-critical period (P14-P17) and the critical period (P18-P21). Over the same developmental period, expression of each TrkB isoform was regulated independently; TrkB.T1 increased, TrkB.FL and TrkB.T2 decreased, and TrkB.T4 showed transient changes. Neither brief visual deprivation nor prolonged dark-rearing induced changes in either TrkB.FL or TrkB.T1 expression. However, TrkB.T4 expression was reduced by brief visual deprivation, whereas TrkB.T4, TrkB.T2 and P75(NTR) were up-regulated by prolonged dark-rearing into the critical period. Our data indicate that TrkB isoform expression can be selectively regulated by visual experience, and may contribute to experience-dependent cortical plasticity.},

Current evidence suggests that neurons detect changes in their own firing rates through a set of calcium-dependent sensors that then regulate receptor trafficking to increase or decrease the accumulation of glutamate receptors at synaptic sites. Additional mechanisms may allow local or network-wide changes in activity to be sensed through parallel pathways, generating a nested set of homeostatic mechanisms that operate over different temporal and spatial scales.},

Little is known about the molecular pathway(s) involved, nor is it clear which aspect of "activity"-local synaptic signaling, postsynaptic firing, or large-scale changes in network activity-is required to induce synaptic scaling. Here, we selectively block either postsynaptic firing in individual neurons or a fraction of presynaptic inputs, while optically monitoring changes in synaptic strength. We find that synaptic scaling is rapidly induced by block of postsynaptic firing, but not by local synaptic blockade, and is mediated through a drop in somatic calcium influx, reduced activation of CaMKIV, and an increase in transcription. Cortical neurons thus homeostatically adjust synaptic strengths in response to changes in their own firing rate, a mechanism with the computational advantage of efficiently normalizing synaptic strengths without interfering with synapse-specific mechanisms of information storage.},

Where and when these different forms of plasticity are expressed at particular synapse types within cortical microcircuits, and how they interact, is poorly understood. Here we investigated how two different visual deprivation paradigms, lid suture (LS) and intraocular TTX, affect the local microcircuit within layer 2/3 of rat visual cortex during the classical critical period for visual system plasticity. Both forms of visual deprivation produced a compensatory increase in the spontaneous firing of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in acute slices derived from monocular visual cortex. TTX increased spontaneous activity through an increase in the excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance within layer 2/3. In contrast, LS decreased the E/I balance by strongly depressing excitatory transmission, and the homeostatic increase in spontaneous activity was instead achieved through an increase in the intrinsic excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. The microcircuit in layer 2/3 can thus use different forms of homeostatic plasticity to compensate for the loss of visual drive, depending on the specific demands produced by visual experience. The existence of multiple, partially redundant forms of homeostatic plasticity may ensure that network compensation can be achieved in response to a wide range of sensory perturbations.},

Here we used time-lapse imaging to examine the synaptic interactions between pairs of cultured cortical pyramidal neurons, and found that the axon-dendrite contacts between each neuronal pair were composed of both a relatively stable and a more labile population. Under basal conditions, loss and gain of contacts within this labile population was well balanced and there was little net change in connectivity. Selectively increasing the levels of activated CaMKII in the postsynaptic neuron increased connectivity between pairs of neurons by increasing the rate of gain of new contacts without affecting the probability of contact loss, or the proportion of stable and labile contacts, and this increase required Calcium/calmodulin binding to CaMKII. Our data suggest that activating CaMKII can increase synaptic connectivity through a CaM-dependent increase in contact formation, followed by stabilization of a constant fraction of new contacts.},

In this chapter, we discuss some of the plasticity mechanisms underlying the experience-dependent rewiring of visual cortical microcircuits focusing on layer 4 of rat primary visual cortex. The microcircuit in layer 4 has the ability to regulate its excitability by shifting the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in an experience-dependent manner. Early in postnatal development (shortly after eye opening), visual deprivation activates several forms of homeostatic plasticity that cooperate to adjust layer 4 excitability to compensate for reduced sensory drive. In contrast, during the classical sensitive period for rodent visual system plasticity, this homeostatic response is replaced by mechanisms that reduce the responsiveness of deprived cortex. We discuss this developmentally regulated switch in plasticity within layer 4 and how this might depend on the maturation of excitatory and inhibitory monosynaptic connections. Based on our published data, we propose inhibitory plasticity as an important player in circuit refinement that can contribute both to the compensatory forms of circuit plasticity in the early stages of development and to the pathological loss of function induced by visual deprivation during the critical period.},

Numerous new NMD candidates, some with potential to affect synaptic activity, were also identified computationally.

However, the molecular identity of these signaling components has not been firmly established. Recent work suggests that there are likely to be multiple forms of synaptic homeostasis, mediated by distinct signaling pathways and with distinct expression mechanisms. These include presynaptic forms that depend on retrograde signaling to presynaptic Ca(2+) channels, and postsynaptic forms influenced by BDNF, TNFalpha and Arc signaling. Current challenges include matching signaling elements to their functions (i.e. as detectors of activity, as part of the set-point mechanism and/or as effectors of synaptic change), and fitting these molecular candidates into a unified view of the signaling pathways that underlie synaptic homeostasis.},

Here we show that changes in synaptic strength elicited by pairing high frequency pre- and postsynaptic firing at this synapse result from a mixture of presynaptic and postsynaptic forms of plasticity, as assessed by the analysis of changes in coefficient of variation, short-term plasticity, and NMDA:AMPA current ratios. Pharmacological dissection of this plasticity revealed that block of presynaptic LTD with an endocannabinoid inhibitor enhanced LTP, while the apparently presynaptic component of LTP could be prevented by induction in the presence of blockers of nitric oxide. These data suggest that correlated high-frequency firing at layer-5 synapses simultaneously induces a mixture of presynaptic LTD, presynaptic LTP, and postsynaptic LTP.},

  abstract        = {Homeostatic plasticity of excitatory synapses plays an important role in stabilizing neuronal activity, but the mechanism of this form of plasticity is incompletely understood. In particular, whether the locus of expression is presynaptic or postsynaptic has been controversial. Here we show that the expression locus depends on the time neurons have spent in vitro. In visual cortical cultures < or =14 days in vitro (DIV), 2 days of TTX treatment induced an increase in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude onto pyramidal neurons, without affecting mEPSC frequency. However, in cultures > or =18 DIV, the same TTX treatment induced a large increase in mEPSC frequency, whereas the amplitude effect was reduced. The increased mEPSC frequency was associated with an increased density of excitatory synapses and increased presynaptic vesicle release in response to electrical stimulation. This indicates a shift from a predominantly postsynaptic response to TTX in < or =14 DIV cultures, to a coordinated pre- and postsynaptic response in > or =18 DIV cultures. This shift was not specific for cortical cultures because a similar shift was observed in cultured hippocampal neurons. Culturing neurons from older animals showed that the timing of the switch depends on the time the neurons have spent in vitro, rather than their postnatal age. This temporal switch in expression locus can largely reconcile the contradictory literature on the expression locus of homeostatic excitatory synaptic plasticity in central neurons. Furthermore, our results raise the intriguing possibility that the expression mechanism of homeostatic plasticity can be tailored to the needs of the network during different stages of development or in response to different challenges to network function.},

  abstract        = {The fine-tuning of circuits in sensory cortex requires sensory experience during an early critical period. Visual deprivation during the critical period has catastrophic effects on visual function, including loss of visual responsiveness to the deprived eye, reduced visual acuity, and loss of tuning to many stimulus characteristics. These changes occur faster than the remodelling of thalamocortical axons, but the intracortical plasticity mechanisms that underlie them are incompletely understood. Long-term depression of excitatory intracortical synapses has been proposed as a general candidate mechanism for the loss of cortical responsiveness after visual deprivation. Alternatively (or in addition), the decreased ability of the deprived eye to activate cortical neurons could be due to enhanced intracortical inhibition. Here we show that visual deprivation leaves excitatory connections in layer 4 (the primary input layer to cortex) unaffected, but markedly potentiates inhibitory feedback between fast-spiking basket cells (FS cells) and star pyramidal neurons (star pyramids). Further, a previously undescribed form of long-term potentiation of inhibition (LTPi) could be induced at synapses from FS cells to star pyramids, and was occluded by previous visual deprivation. These data suggest that potentiation of inhibition is a major cellular mechanism underlying the deprivation-induced degradation of visual function, and that this form of LTPi is important in fine-tuning cortical circuitry in response to visual experience.},

  abstract        = {Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a devastating neurological disorder that is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene. Mecp2-mutant mice have been used as a model system to study the disease mechanism. Our previous work has suggested that MeCP2 malfunction in neurons is the primary cause of RTT in the mouse. However, the neurophysiological consequences of MeCP2 malfunction remain obscure. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in cortical slices, we show that spontaneous activity of pyramidal neurons is reduced in Mecp2-mutant mice. This decrease is not caused by a change in the intrinsic properties of the recorded neurons. Instead, the balance between cortical excitation and inhibition is shifted to favor inhibition over excitation. Moreover, analysis of the miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs)/inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in the Mecp2-mutant cortex reveals a reduction in mEPSC amplitudes, without significant change in the average mIPSC amplitude or frequency. These findings provide the first detailed electrophysiological analysis of Mecp2-mutant mice and provide a framework for understanding the pathophysiology of the disease and tools for studying the underlying disease mechanisms.},

  abstract        = {Synaptic scaling is a form of homeostatic plasticity that scales synaptic strengths up or down to compensate for prolonged changes in activity. It has been controversial whether this plasticity is expressed presynaptically, postsynaptically, or both. Here we describe in detail the homeostatic changes that take place at excitatory synapses in visual cortical cultures after 1 or 2 d of activity blockade. After 7-10 d in vitro, activity blockade significantly increased postsynaptic accumulation of synaptic AMPA receptors via proportional increases in glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) and GluR2. Time-lapse imaging of enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged AMPA receptors revealed that receptor accumulation increased progressively over 2 d of activity blockade and affected the entire population of imaged synapses. The strength of synaptic connections between pyramidal neurons was more than doubled after activity blockade without affecting short-term depression or the coefficient of variation of the postsynaptic responses. Furthermore, uptake of the fluorescent styryl dye FM1-43 (N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-[4-(dibutylamino)styryl] pyridinium dibromide) by presynaptic terminals was not different at control and activity-blocked synapses. In addition to the increased accumulation of postsynaptic AMPA receptors, boosting of dendritic AMPA currents by sodium channels was increased by activity blockade. These data indicate that, at young neocortical synapses, synaptic scaling has a predominantly postsynaptic locus and functions as a gain control mechanism to regulate neuronal activity without affecting the dynamics of synaptic transmission.},

Slice recordings showed that spontaneous activity of layer 4 star pyramidal neurons increased 25-fold after 2 d of visual deprivation between postnatal days (P) 15 and P17. This effect was mediated by increased net excitatory and decreased net inhibitory synaptic drive. Paired recordings showed that excitatory connections between star pyramidal neurons doubled in amplitude, whereas inhibitory connections decreased or increased depending on the interneuron class. These effects reversed when vision was restored. This dynamic adjustment of the excitation-inhibition balance may allow the networks within layer 4 to maintain stable levels of activity in the face of variable sensory input.},

Also like tLTD, dLTD was blocked by CB1 cannibinoid receptor blockade and required activation of presumably presynaptic NR2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. The two forms of LTD had identical magnitudes and time courses and occluded one another, and neither depended on frequency. Finally, dLTD shares with tLTD the asymmetric temporal window of induction. In conclusion, the types of LTD induced by these two protocols are indistinguishable, suggesting that the mechanism that underlies tLTD paradoxically does not require postsynaptic spiking: The subthreshold postsynaptic depolarizations of dLTD appear to fully substitute for postsynaptic spiking.},

Even for neurons that are visually distinguishable, there is no common ground to consistently define morphological types. The objective classification of PCs can be achieved with methods from algebraic topology, and the dendritic arborization is sufficient for the reliable identification of distinct types of cortical PCs. Therefore, we objectively identify 17 types of PCs in the rat somatosensory cortex. In addition, we provide a solution to the challenging problem of whether 2 similar neurons belong to different types or to a continuum of the same type. Our topological classification does not require expert input, is stable, and helps settle the long-standing debate on whether cell-types are discrete or continuous morphological variations of each other.},

  abstract        = {In the study of neural circuits, it becomes essential to discern the different neuronal cell types that build the circuit. Traditionally, neuronal cell types have been classified using qualitative descriptors. More recently, several attempts have been made to classify neurons quantitatively, using unsupervised clustering methods. While useful, these algorithms do not take advantage of previous information known to the investigator, which could improve the classification task. For neocortical GABAergic interneurons, the problem to discern among different cell types is particularly difficult and better methods are needed to perform objective classifications. Here we explore the use of supervised classification algorithms to classify neurons based on their morphological features, using a database of 128 pyramidal cells and 199 interneurons from mouse neocortex. To evaluate the performance of different algorithms we used, as a "benchmark," the test to automatically distinguish between pyramidal cells and interneurons, defining "ground truth" by the presence or absence of an apical dendrite. We compared hierarchical clustering with a battery of different supervised classification algorithms, finding that supervised classifications outperformed hierarchical clustering. In addition, the selection of subsets of distinguishing features enhanced the classification accuracy for both sets of algorithms. The analysis of selected variables indicates that dendritic features were most useful to distinguish pyramidal cells from interneurons when compared with somatic and axonal morphological variables. We conclude that supervised classification algorithms are better matched to the general problem of distinguishing neuronal cell types when some information on these cell groups, in our case being pyramidal or interneuron, is known a priori. As a spin-off of this methodological study, we provide several methods to automatically distinguish neocortical pyramidal cells from interneurons, based on their morphologies.},

Although recent neuronal-network models capture many qualitative aspects of M1 dynamics, they can generate only a few distinct movements. Additionally, it is unclear how M1 efficiently controls movements over a wide range of shapes and speeds. We demonstrate that modulation of neuronal input-output gains in recurrent neuronal-network models with a fixed architecture can dramatically reorganize neuronal activity and thus downstream muscle outputs. Consistent with the observation of diffuse neuromodulatory projections to M1, a relatively small number of modulatory control units provide sufficient flexibility to adjust high-dimensional network activity using a simple reward-based learning rule. Furthermore, it is possible to assemble novel movements from previously learned primitives, and one can separately change movement speed while preserving movement shape. Our results provide a new perspective on the role of modulatory systems in controlling recurrent cortical activity.},

Here we introduce a class of cortical architectures with strong and random excitatory recurrence that is stabilized by intricate, fine-tuned inhibition, optimized from a control theory perspective. Such networks transiently amplify specific activity states and can be used to reliably execute multidimensional movement patterns. Similar to the experimental observations, these transients must be preceded by a steady-state initialization phase from which the network relaxes back into the background state by way of complex internal dynamics. In our networks, excitation and inhibition are as tightly balanced as recently reported in experiments across several brain areas, suggesting inhibitory control of complex excitatory recurrence as a generic organizational principle in cortex.},

Hence, Hebbian plasticity forms a positive feedback loop that can lead to instability in simulated neural networks. To keep activity at healthy, low levels, plasticity must therefore incorporate homeostatic control mechanisms. We find in numerical simulations of recurrent networks with a realistic triplet-based spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule (triplet STDP) that homeostasis has to detect rate changes on a timescale of seconds to minutes to keep the activity stable. We confirm this result in a generic mean-field formulation of network activity and homeostatic plasticity. Our results strongly suggest the existence of a homeostatic regulatory mechanism that reacts to firing rate changes on the order of seconds to minutes.},

One is induced by the presence of near-critical eigenvalues in the connectivity matrix W, producing large but slow activity fluctuations along the corresponding eigenvectors (dynamical slowing). The other relies on W not being normal, which allows the network activity to make large but fast excursions along specific directions. Here we investigate the trade-off between non-normal amplification and dynamical slowing in the spontaneous activity of large random neuronal networks composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We use a Schur decomposition of W to separate the two amplification mechanisms. Assuming linear stochastic dynamics, we derive an exact expression for the expected amount of purely non-normal amplification. We find that amplification is very limited if dynamical slowing must be kept weak. We conclude that, to achieve strong transient amplification with little slowing, the connectivity must be structured. We show that unidirectional connections between neurons of the same type together with reciprocal connections between neurons of different types, allow for amplification already in the fast dynamical regime. Finally, our results also shed light on the differences between balanced networks in which inhibition exactly cancels excitation and those where inhibition dominates.},

Achieving maximal information transmission has also been recently postulated as a role for spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). However, the link between optimal plasticity and STDP in cortex remains loose, as does the relationship between STDP and adaptation processes. We investigate how STDP, as described by recent minimal models derived from experimental data, influences the quality of information transmission in an adapting neuron. We show that a phenomenological model based on triplets of spikes yields almost the same information rate as an optimal model specially designed to this end. In contrast, the standard pair-based model of STDP does not improve information transmission as much. This result holds not only for additive STDP with hard weight bounds, known to produce bimodal distributions of synaptic weights, but also for weight-dependent STDP in the context of unimodal but skewed weight distributions. We analyze the similarities between the triplet model and the optimal learning rule, and find that the triplet effect is an important feature of the optimal model when the neuron is adaptive. If STDP is optimized for information transmission, it must take into account the dynamical properties of the postsynaptic cell, which might explain the target-cell specificity of STDP. In particular, it accounts for the differences found in vitro between STDP at excitatory synapses onto principal cells and those onto fast-spiking interneurons.},

  abstract        = {We recreated in vitro the fluctuation-driven regime observed at the soma during asynchronous network activity in vivo and we studied the firing rate response as a function of the properties of the membrane potential fluctuations. We provide a simple analytical template that captures the firing response of both pyramidal neurons and various theoretical models. We found a strong heterogeneity in the firing rate response of layer V pyramidal neurons: in particular, individual neurons differ not only in their mean excitability level, but also in their sensitivity to fluctuations. Theoretical modelling suggest that this observed heterogeneity might arise from various expression levels of the following biophysical properties: sodium inactivation, density of sodium channels and spike frequency adaptation. Characterizing the input-output properties of neocortical neurons is of crucial importance for understanding the properties emerging at the network level. In the regime of low-rate irregular firing (such as in the awake state), determining those properties for neocortical cells remains, however, both experimentally and theoretically challenging. Here, we studied this problem using a combination of theoretical modelling and in vitro experiments. We first identified, theoretically, three somatic variables that describe the dynamical state at the soma in this fluctuation-driven regime: the mean, standard deviation and time constant of the membrane potential fluctuations. Next, we characterized the firing rate response of individual layer V pyramidal cells in this three-dimensional space by means of perforated-patch recordings and dynamic clamp in the visual cortex of juvenile mice in vitro. We found that individual neurons strongly differ not only in terms of their excitability, but also, and unexpectedly, in their sensitivities to fluctuations. Finally, using theoretical modelling, we attempted to reproduce these results. The model predicts that heterogeneous levels of biophysical properties such as sodium inactivation, sharpness of sodium activation and spike frequency adaptation account for the observed diversity of firing rate responses. Because the firing rate response will determine population rate dynamics during asynchronous neocortical activity, our results show that cortical populations are functionally strongly inhomogeneous in young mouse visual cortex, which should have important consequences on the strategies of cortical computation at early stages of sensory processing.},

Here, we show that neuronal networks displaying asynchronous irregular (AI) activity can implement a low-level form of awareness, due to their specific responsiveness properties. We emphasize the importance of the conductance state and stochasticity to explain these properties. We suggest that the purpose of cortical structures is to generate AI states with optimal responsiveness, to be globally aware of external stimuli.},

Since for each pixel VSDi signals report the average membrane potential over hundreds of neurons, it seems natural to use a mean-field formalism to model such signals. Here, we present a mean-field model of networks of Adaptive Exponential (AdEx) integrate-and-fire neurons, with conductance-based synaptic interactions. We study a network of regular-spiking (RS) excitatory neurons and fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory neurons. We use a Master Equation formalism, together with a semi-analytic approach to the transfer function of AdEx neurons to describe the average dynamics of the coupled populations. We compare the predictions of this mean-field model to simulated networks of RS-FS cells, first at the level of the spontaneous activity of the network, which is well predicted by the analytical description. Second, we investigate the response of the network to time-varying external input, and show that the mean-field model predicts the response time course of the population. Finally, to model VSDi signals, we consider a one-dimensional ring model made of interconnected RS-FS mean-field units. We found that this model can reproduce the spatio-temporal patterns seen in VSDi of awake monkey visual cortex as a response to local and transient visual stimuli. Conversely, we show that the model allows one to infer physiological parameters from the experimentally-recorded spatio-temporal patterns.},

  abstract        = {In this study, we present a theoretical framework combining experimental characterizations and analytical calculus to capture the firing rate input-output properties of single neurons in the fluctuation-driven regime. Our framework consists of a two-step procedure to treat independently how the dendritic input translates into somatic fluctuation variables, and how the latter determine action potential firing. We use this framework to investigate the functional impact of the heterogeneity in firing responses found experimentally in young mice layer V pyramidal cells. We first design and calibrate in vitro a simplified morphological model of layer V pyramidal neurons with a dendritic tree following Rall's branching rule. Then, we propose an analytical derivation for the membrane potential fluctuations at the soma as a function of the properties of the synaptic input in dendrites. This mathematical description allows us to easily emulate various forms of synaptic input: either balanced, unbalanced, synchronized, purely proximal or purely distal synaptic activity. We find that those different forms of dendritic input activity lead to various impact on the somatic membrane potential fluctuations properties, thus raising the possibility that individual neurons will differentially couple to specific forms of activity as a result of their different firing response. We indeed found such a heterogeneous coupling between synaptic input and firing response for all types of presynaptic activity. This heterogeneity can be explained by different levels of cellular excitability in the case of the balanced, unbalanced, synchronized and purely distal activity. A notable exception appears for proximal dendritic inputs: increasing the input level can either promote firing response in some cells, or suppress it in some other cells whatever their individual excitability. This behavior can be explained by different sensitivities to the speed of the fluctuations, which was previously associated to different levels of sodium channel inactivation and density. Because local network connectivity rather targets proximal dendrites, our results suggest that this aspect of biophysical heterogeneity might be relevant to neocortical processing by controlling how individual neurons couple to local network activity.},

  abstract        = {The cortical network recurrent circuitry generates spontaneous activity organized into Up (active) and Down (quiescent) states during slow-wave sleep or anesthesia. These different states of cortical activation gain modulate synaptic transmission. However, the reported modulation that Up states impose on synaptic inputs is disparate in the literature, including both increases and decreases of responsiveness. Here, we tested the hypothesis that such disparate observations may depend on the intensity of the stimulation. By means of intracellular recordings, we studied synaptic transmission during Up and Down states in rat auditory cortex in vivo. Synaptic potentials were evoked either by auditory or electrical (thalamocortical, intracortical) stimulation while randomly varying the intensity of the stimulus. Synaptic potentials evoked by the same stimulus intensity were compared in Up/Down states. Up states had a scaling effect on the stimulus-evoked synaptic responses: the amplitude of weaker responses was potentiated whereas that of larger responses was maintained or decreased with respect to the amplitude during Down states. We used a computational model to explore the potential mechanisms explaining this nontrivial stimulus-response relationship. During Up/Down states, there is different excitability in the network and the neuronal conductance varies. We demonstrate that the competition between presynaptic recruitment and the changing conductance might be the central mechanism explaining the experimentally observed stimulus-response relationships. We conclude that the effect that cortical network activation has on synaptic transmission is not constant but contingent on the strength of the stimulation, with a larger modulation for stimuli involving both thalamic and cortical networks.},

We investigated the neuronal correlates of cortical barrel activity in the two corresponding thalamic nuclei, the ventral posterior medial (VPM), and the posterior medial (Pom) nuclei during natural NREM in mice. Our data reveal (1) distinct modulations of VPM and Pom activity throughout NREM episodes, (2) a thalamic nucleus-specific phase-locking to cortical slow and spindle waves, (3) cell-specific subthreshold spindle oscillations in VPM neurons that only partially overlap with cortical spindles, and (4) that spindle features evolve throughout NREM episodes and vary according to the post-NREM state. Taken together, our results suggest that, during natural sleep, the barrel cortex exerts a leading role in the generation and transfer of slow rhythms to the somatosensory thalamus and reciprocally for spindle oscillations.},

The probes comprise an array of ten bare light-emitting diode (LED) chips emitting at a wavelength of 460 nm and integrated along a flexible polyimide-based substrate stiffened using a micromachined ladder-like silicon structure. The resulting mechanical stiffness of the slender, 250-μm-wide, 65-μm-thick, and 5- and 8-mm-long probe shank facilitates its implantation into neural tissue. The LEDs are encapsulated by a fluropolymer coating protecting the implant against the physiological conditions in the brain. The electrical interface to the external control unit is provided by 10-μm-thick, highly flexible polyimide cables making the probes suitable for both acute and chronic in vivo experiments. Optical and electrical properties of the probes are reported, as well as their in vivo validation in acute optogenetic studies in transgenic mice. The depth-dependent optical stimulation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons is demonstrated by altering the brain activity in the cortex and the thalamus. Local network responses elicited by 20-ms-long light pulses of different optical power (20 μW and 1 mW), as well as local modulation of single unit neuronal activity to 1-s-long light pulses with low optical intensity (17 μW) are presented. The ability to modulate neural activity makes these devices suitable for a broad variety of optogenetic experiments.},

Here, we investigated how cells in rodent area S1BF are entrained by rhythmic fluctuations at various frequencies within the local area and in connected areas, and how this depends on behavioral state and cell type. We performed simultaneous extracellular field and unit recordings in four connected areas of the freely moving rat (S1BF, V1M, perirhinal cortex, CA1). S1BF spiking activity was strongly entrained by both beta and gamma S1BF oscillations, which were associated with deactivations and activations, respectively. We identified multiple classes of fast spiking and excitatory cells in S1BF, which showed prominent differences in rhythmic entrainment and in the extent to which phase locking was modulated by behavioral state. Using an additional dataset acquired by whole-cell recordings in head-fixed mice, these cell classes could be compared with identified phenotypes showing gamma rhythmicity in their membrane potential. We next examined how S1BF cells were entrained by rhythmic fluctuations in connected brain areas. Gamma-synchronization was detected in all four areas, however we did not detect significant gamma coherence among these areas. Instead, we only found long-range coherence in the theta-beta range among these areas. In contrast to local S1BF synchronization, we found long-range S1BF-spike to CA1-LFP synchronization to be homogeneous across inhibitory and excitatory cell types. These findings suggest distinct, cell-type contributions of low and high-frequency synchronization to intra- and inter-areal neuronal interactions.},

We find heterogeneous state-dependent dynamics in both nuclei, with an overall increase in action potential firing during active states. Whisking increased putative lemniscal and corticothalamic excitatory inputs onto VPM and Pom neurons, respectively. A subpopulation of VPM cells fired spikes phase-locked to the whisking cycle during free whisking, and these cells may therefore signal whisker position. Our results suggest differential processing of whisking comparing thalamic nuclei at both sub- and supra-threshold levels.},

We found unique membrane potential dynamics of somatostatin-expressing (SOM) neurons in layer 2/3 of the primary somatosensory barrel cortex of awake behaving mice. SOM neurons were spontaneously active during periods of quiet wakefulness. However, SOM neurons hyperpolarized and reduced action potential firing in response to both passive and active whisker sensing, in contrast with all other recorded types of nearby neurons, which were excited by sensory input. Optogenetic inhibition of SOM neurons increased burst firing in nearby excitatory neurons. We hypothesize that the spontaneous activity of SOM neurons during quiet wakefulness provides a tonic inhibition to the distal dendrites of excitatory pyramidal neurons. Conversely, the inhibition of SOM cells during active cortical processing likely enhances distal dendritic excitability, which may be important for top-down computations and sensorimotor integration.},

  abstract        = {Analgesic neurosteroids such as 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one (5alpha3alpha) are potent selective endogenous modulators of the GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) while certain synthetic derivatives (i.e. minaxolone) additionally enhance the function of recombinant glycine receptors (GlyR). Inhibitory transmission within the superficial dorsal horn has been implicated in mediating the analgesic actions of neurosteroids. However, the relative contribution played by synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors is unknown. In this study, we have compared the actions of 5alpha3alpha and minaxolone upon inhibitory transmission mediated by both GABA(A) and strychnine-sensitive GlyRs in lamina II neurones of juvenile (P15-21) rats. At the near physiological temperature of 35 degrees C and at a holding potential of -60 mV we recorded three kinetically distinct populations of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs): GlyR-mediated, GABA(A)R-mediated and mixed GABA(A)R-GlyR mIPSCs, arising from the corelease of both inhibitory neurotransmitters. In addition, sequential application of strychnine and bicuculline revealed a small (5.2 +/- 1.0 pA) GlyR- but not a GABA(A)R-mediated tonic conductance. 5alpha3alpha (1-10 microm) prolonged GABA(A)R and mixed mIPSCs in a concentration-dependent manner but was without effect upon GlyR mIPSCs. In contrast, minaxolone (1-10 microm) prolonged the decay of GlyR mIPSCs and, additionally, was approximately 10-fold more potent than 5alpha3alpha upon GABA(A)R mIPSCs. However, 5alpha3alpha and minaxolone (1 microm) evoked a similar bicuculline-sensitive inhibitory conductance, indicating that the extrasynaptic GABA(A)Rs do not discriminate between these two steroids. Furthermore, approximately 92% of the effect of 1 microm 5alpha3alpha upon GABAergic inhibition could be accounted for by its action upon the extrasynaptic conductance. These findings are relevant to modulation of inhibitory circuits within spinally mediated pain pathways and suggest that extrasynaptic GABA(A)Rs may represent a relevant molecular target for the analgesic actions of neurosteroids.},

  abstract        = {Dopamine is released from both axonal and somatodendritic sites of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in an action potential-dependent manner. In contrast to the majority of central neurons, the axon of dopaminergic neurons typically originates from a dendritic site, suggesting a specialized computational function. Here, we examine the initiation and spread of action potentials in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars reticulata and reveal that the displacement of the axon to a dendritic site allows highly compartmentalized electrical signaling. In response to a train of synaptic input, action potentials initiated at axon-bearing dendritic sites formed a variable trigger for invasion to the soma and contralateral dendritic tree, with action potentials often confined to the axon-bearing dendrite. The application of dopamine increased this form of electrical compartmentalization, an effect mediated by a tonic membrane potential hyperpolarization leading to an increased availability of a class of voltage-dependent potassium channel. These data suggest that the release of dopamine from axonal and somatodendritic sites are dissociable, and that dopamine levels within the midbrain are dynamically controlled by the somatodendritic spread of action potentials.},

  abstract        = {Dysfunction of GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition is implicated in a number of neurological and psychiatric conditions including epilepsy and affective disorders. Some of these conditions have been associated with abnormal levels of certain endogenously occurring neurosteroids, which potently and selectively enhance the function of the brain's major inhibitory receptor, the GABA(A) receptor. Consistent with their ability to enhance neuronal inhibition, such steroids exhibit in animals and humans anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and anesthetic actions. Neurosteroids, exemplified by the potent progesterone metabolite, 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one can be synthesized de novo in the CNS both in neurones and glia in levels sufficient to modulate GABA(A) receptor function. Neurosteroid levels are not static, but are subject to dynamic fluctuations, for example during stress, or the later stages of pregnancy. These observations suggest that these endogenous modulators may refine the function of the brain's major inhibitory receptor and thus, play an important physiological and pathophysiological role. However, given the ubiquitous expression of GABA(A) receptors throughout the mammalian CNS, changes in neurosteroid levels should be widely experienced, causing a generalized enhancement of neuronal inhibition. Such a non-specific action would seem incompatible with a physiological role. However, neurosteroid action is both brain region and neurone selective. This specificity results from a variety of molecular mechanisms including receptor subunit composition, local steroid metabolism and phosphorylation. This paper will evaluate the relative contribution these mechanisms play in defining the interaction of neurosteroids with synaptic and extra-synaptic GABA(A) receptors.},

  abstract        = {Corticothalamic (CT) feedback projections to the thalamus outnumber sensory inputs from the periphery by orders of magnitude. However, their functional role remains elusive. CT projections may directly excite thalamic relay cells or indirectly inhibit them via excitation of the nucleus reticularis thalami (nRT), a nuclear formation composed entirely of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic neurons. The relative strengths of these two pathways will ultimately control the effects of CT projections on the output of thalamic relay cells. However, corticoreticular synapses have not yet been fully physiologically characterized. Here, local stimulation of layer VI cells by focal application of K+ or AMPA elicited excitatory postsynaptic potentials in nRT neurons with a mean peak amplitude of 2.4 +/- 0.1 mV (n = 75, mean +/- SEM), a mean rise time (10-90%) of 0.74 +/- 0.03 ms and a weighted decay time constant of 11 +/- 0.3 ms. A pharmacological profile of responses was drawn in both current-clamp and voltage-clamp modes, showing the presence of a small N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-dependent component at depolarized potentials. In two pairs of synaptically coupled layer VI cell-nRT neuron, moderate rates of transmission failures were observed while the latencies were above 5 ms in both cases. Our results indicate that the corticoreticular pathway fulfills the criteria for 'modulatory' inputs and is temporally restricted. We suggest that it may be involved in coincidence detection of convergent corticoreticular signals.},

Here, we characterised the actions of the R-(+)- and S-(-)-enantiomers of etomidate. In mice and tadpoles, R-(+)-etomidate was more potent (approximately 10-fold) than S-(-)-etomidate in producing loss of the righting reflex. In electrophysiological and radioligand binding assays, the enantiomers of etomidate positively regulated GABAA receptor function at anaesthetic concentrations and with an enantioselectivity paralleling their in vivo activity. GABA-evoked currents mediated by human recombinant GABAA receptors were potentiated by either R-(+)- or S-(-)-etomidate in a manner dependent upon receptor subunit composition. A direct, GABA-mimetic, effect was similarly subunit dependent. Modulation of GABA receptor activity was selective; R-(+)-etomidate inhibited nicotinic acetylcholine, or 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor subtypes only at supra-clinical concentrations and ionotropic glutamate receptor isoforms were essentially unaffected. Acting upon reticulothalamic neurones in rat brain slices, R-(+)-etomidate prolonged the duration of miniature IPSCs and modestly enhanced their peak amplitude. S-(-)-etomidate exerted qualitatively similar, but weaker, actions. In a model of locomotor activity, fictive swimming in Xenopus laevis tadpoles, R-(+)- but not S-(-)-etomidate exerted a depressant influence via enhancement of GABAergic neurotransmission. Collectively, these observations strongly implicate the GABAA receptor as a molecular target relevant to the anaesthetic action of etomidate.},

At 34-36 degrees C, single presynaptic APs evoked unitary EPSPs in nRT cells with a peak amplitude of 7.4 +/- 1.5 mV (mean +/- S.E.M.) and a decay time constant of 15.1 +/- 0.9 ms. Only four out of 22 pairs showed transmission failures at a mean rate of 6.8 +/- 1.1 %. An NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated component was significant at rest and subsequent EPSPs in a train were depressed. Only one out of 14 pairs tested was reciprocally connected; the observed IPSPs in the VB cell had a peak amplitude of 0.8 mV and were completely abolished in the presence of 10 microM bicuculline. Thus, synaptic connections from VB cells to nRT neurones are mainly 'drivers', while a small subset of cells form closed disynaptic loops.},

The unbinding of three strychnine molecules and the cooperative binding of two glycine molecules were required to activate the channel.

Phosphorylation accelerated desensitisation, but slowed deactivation and recovery from desensitisation. A chemical-kinetic model was developed that reproduced the experimental observations.

The exponential decay of the capacitative charging current was analyzed to give the total membrane capacitance, which was then divided by the observed surface area of the patch. C(m) was 0.9 microF/cm(2) for each class of neuron. To test the possibility that membrane proteins may alter C(m), embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) were studied before and after transfection with a plasmid coding for glycine receptor/channels. The value of C(m) was indistinguishable in untransfected cells and in transfected cells expressing a high level of glycine channels, indicating that differences in transmembrane protein content do not significantly affect C(m).

  abstract        = {Cortical gamma activity (30-80 Hz) is believed to play important functions in neural computation and arises from the interplay of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV) and pyramidal cells (PYRs). However, the subthreshold dynamics underlying its emergence in the cortex of awake animals remain unclear. Here, we characterized the intracellular dynamics of PVs and PYRs during spontaneous and visually evoked gamma activity in layers 2/3 of V1 of awake mice using targeted patch-clamp recordings and synchronous local field potentials (LFPs). Strong gamma activity patterned in short bouts (one to three cycles), occurred when PVs and PYRs were depolarizing and entrained their membrane potential dynamics regardless of the presence of visual stimulation. PV firing phase locked unconditionally to gamma activity. However, PYRs only phase locked to visually evoked gamma bouts. Taken together, our results indicate that gamma activity corresponds to short pulses of correlated background synaptic activity synchronizing the output of cortical neurons depending on external sensory drive.},

  abstract        = {Synaptic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neocortical neurons are important for mammalian sensory perception. Synaptic transmission between identified neurons within neocortical microcircuits has mainly been studied in brain slice preparations in vitro. Here, we investigate brain-state-dependent neocortical synaptic interactions in vivo by combining the specificity of optogenetic stimulation with the precision of whole-cell recordings from postsynaptic excitatory glutamatergic neurons and GFP-labeled inhibitory GABAergic neurons targeted through two-photon microscopy. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) stimulation of excitatory layer 2/3 barrel cortex neurons evoked larger and faster depolarizing postsynaptic potentials and more synaptically driven action potentials in fast-spiking (FS) GABAergic neurons compared to both non-fast-spiking (NFS) GABAergic neurons and postsynaptic excitatory pyramidal neurons located within the same neocortical microcircuit. The number of action potentials evoked in ChR2-expressing neurons showed low trial-to-trial variability, but postsynaptic responses varied strongly with near-linear dependence upon spontaneously driven changes in prestimulus membrane potential. Postsynaptic responses in excitatory neurons had reversal potentials, which were hyperpolarized relative to action potential threshold and were therefore inhibitory. Reversal potentials measured in postsynaptic GABAergic neurons were close to action potential threshold. Postsynaptic inhibitory neurons preferentially fired synaptically driven action potentials from spontaneously depolarized network states, with stronger state-dependent modulation in NFS GABAergic neurons compared to FS GABAergic neurons. Inhibitory neurons appear to dominate neocortical microcircuit function, receiving stronger local excitatory synaptic input and firing more action potentials compared to excitatory neurons. In mouse layer 2/3 barrel cortex, we propose that strong state-dependent recruitment of inhibitory neurons drives competition among excitatory neurons enforcing sparse coding.},

  abstract     = {Although the neocortex forms a distributed system comprised of several functional areas, its vertical columnar organization is largely conserved across areas and species, suggesting the existence of a canonical neocortical microcircuit. In order to elucidate the principles governing the organization of such a cortical diagram, a detailed understanding of the dynamics binding different types of cortical neurons into a coherent algorithm is essential. Within this complex circuitry, GABAergic interneurons, while forming approximately only 15-20% of all cortical neurons, appear critical in maintaining a dynamic balance between excitation and inhibition. Despite their importance, cortical GABAergic neurons have not been extensively studied in vivo and their precise role in shaping the local microcircuit sensory response still remains to be determined. Their paucity, combined with their molecular, anatomical, and physiological diversity, has made it difficult to even establish a consensual nomenclature. However, recent technological advances in microscopy and mouse genetics have fostered a renewed interest in neocortical interneurons by putting them within "visible" reach of experimenters. The anatomically well-defined whisker-to-barrel pathway of the rodent is particularly amenable to studies attempting to link cortical circuit dynamics to behavior. To each whisker corresponds a discrete cortical unit equivalent to a single column, specialized in the encoding and processing of the sensory information it receives. In this review, we will focus on the functional role that each subtype of supragranular GABAergic neuron embedded within such a single neocortical unit may play in shaping the dynamics of the local circuit during somatosensory integration.},

Here, through single and dual whole-cell recordings combined with two-photon microscopy in the barrel cortex of behaving mice, we directly compare the synaptically driven membrane potential dynamics of inhibitory and excitatory layer 2/3 neurons. We find that inhibitory neurons depolarize synchronously with excitatory neurons, but they are much more active with differential contributions of two classes of inhibitory neurons during different brain states. Fast-spiking GABAergic neurons dominate during quiet wakefulness, but during active wakefulness Non-fast-spiking GABAergic neurons depolarize, firing action potentials at increased rates. Sparse uncorrelated action potential firing in excitatory neurons is driven by fast, large, and cell-specific depolarization. In contrast, inhibitory neurons fire correlated action potentials at much higher frequencies driven by slower, smaller, and broadly synchronized depolarization.},

Somatosensory input is often the result of self-generated movement during the active touch of objects, and conversely, sensory information is used to refine motor control. There must therefore be important interactions between sensory and motor pathways, which we chose to investigate in the mouse whisker sensorimotor system. Voltage-sensitive dye was applied to the neocortex of mice to directly image the membrane potential dynamics of sensorimotor cortex with subcolumnar spatial resolution and millisecond temporal precision. Single brief whisker deflections evoked highly distributed depolarizing cortical sensory responses, which began in the primary somatosensory barrel cortex and subsequently excited the whisker motor cortex. The spread of sensory information to motor cortex was dynamically regulated by behavior and correlated with the generation of sensory-evoked whisker movement. Sensory processing in motor cortex may therefore contribute significantly to active tactile sensory perception.},

We demonstrate that, even with such sparse input, it is possible to produce robust orientation selectivity, as well as continuity in the orientation map. We went beyond that to find plausible dynamic regimes of our new model that emulate simultaneously experimental data for a wide range of V1 phenomena, beginning with orientation selectivity but also including diversity in neuronal responses, bimodal distributions of the modulation ratio (the simple/complex classification), and dynamic signatures, such as gamma-band oscillations. Intracortical interactions play a major role in all aspects of the visual functions of the model. We present the first realistic model that has captured the sparseness of magnocellular LGN inputs to the macaque primary visual cortex and successfully derived orientation selectivity from them. Three implications are (1) even in input layers to the visual cortex, the system is less feedforward and more dominated by intracortical signals than previously thought, (2) interactions among cortical neurons in local populations produce dynamics not explained by single neurons, and (3) such dynamics are important for function. Our model also shows that a comprehensive picture is necessary to explain function, because different visual properties are related. This study points to the need for paradigm shifts in neuroscience modeling: greater emphasis on population dynamics and, where possible, a move toward data-driven, comprehensive models.},

This was done by analyzing the behavior of a previously developed, data-driven, large-scale network model that simulated many visual functions of monkey V1 cortex (Chariker et al., 2016). Gamma activity was an emergent property of the model. The model's gamma activity, like that of the real cortex, was (1) episodic, (2) variable in frequency and phase, and (3) graded in power with stimulus variables like orientation. The spike firing of the model's neuronal population was only partially synchronous during multiple firing events (MFEs) that occurred at gamma rates. Detailed analysis of the model's MFEs showed that gamma-band activity was multidimensional in its sources. Most spikes were evoked by excitatory inputs. A large fraction of these inputs came from recurrent excitation within the local circuit, but feedforward and feedback excitation also contributed, either through direct pulsing or by raising the overall baseline. Inhibition was responsible for ending MFEs, but disinhibition led directly to only a small minority of the synchronized spikes. As a potential explanation for the wide range of gamma characteristics observed in different parts of cortex, we found that the relative rise times of AMPA and GABA synaptic conductances have a strong effect on the degree of synchrony in gamma.  Canonical computations used throughout the cerebral cortex are performed in primary visual cortex (V1). Providing theoretical mechanisms for these computations will advance understanding of computation throughout cortex. We studied one dynamical feature, gamma-band rhythms, in a large-scale, data-driven, computational model of monkey V1. Our most significant conclusion is that the sources of gamma band activity are multidimensional. A second major finding is that the relative rise times of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic potentials have strong effects on spike synchrony and peak gamma band power. Insight gained from studying our V1 model can shed light on the functions of other cortical regions.},

We consider here a ring model of spiking neurons, intended as a simplified computational model of a single hypercolumn of the primary visual cortex of primates. Signals that consist of edges with time-varying orientations localized in space are considered. Our model is calibrated to produce spontaneous and driven firing rates roughly consistent with experiments, and our two main findings, for which we offer dynamical explanation on the level of neuronal interactions, are the following. First, we have documented consistent transient overshoots in signal perception following signal switches due to emergent interactions of the E- and I-populations. Second, for continuously moving signals, we have found that accuracy is considerably lower at reversals of orientation than when continuing in the same direction (as when the signal is a rotating bar). To measure performance, we use two metrics, called fidelity and reliability, to compare signals reconstructed by the system to the ones presented and assess trial-to-trial variability. We propose that the same population mechanisms responsible for orientation selectivity also impose constraints on dynamic signal tracking that manifest in perception failures consistent with psychophysical observations.},

We show that dc can be estimated explicitly in terms of network properties and disease parameters, connecting lowered values of dc explicitly to heterogeneity in degree distribution. Our results reveal also that initial delays in the implementation of isolation protocols can have catastrophic consequences in heterogeneous networks.

  abstract        = {This paper proposes that the network dynamics of the mammalian visual cortex are highly structured and strongly shaped by temporally localized barrages of excitatory and inhibitory firing we call 'multiple-firing events' (MFEs). Our proposal is based on careful study of a network of spiking neurons built to reflect the coarse physiology of a small patch of layer 2/3 of V1. When appropriately benchmarked this network is capable of reproducing the qualitative features of a range of phenomena observed in the real visual cortex, including spontaneous background patterns, orientation-specific responses, surround suppression and gamma-band oscillations. Detailed investigation into the relevant regimes reveals causal relationships among dynamical events driven by a strong competition between the excitatory and inhibitory populations. It suggests that along with firing rates, MFE characteristics can be a powerful signature of a regime. Testable predictions based on model observations and dynamical analysis are proposed.},

At the same time, it is well known that such networks can fire synchronously. Between these two much studied scenarios lies a vastly complex dynamical landscape that is relatively unexplored. In this paper, we discuss a phenomenon which commonly manifests in these intermediate regimes, namely brief spurts of spiking activity which we call multiple firing events (MFE). These events do not depend on structured network architecture nor on structured input; they are an emergent property of the system. We came upon them in an earlier modeling paper, in which we discovered, through a careful benchmarking process, that MFEs are the single most important dynamical mechanism behind many of the V1 phenomena we were able to replicate. In this paper we explain in a simpler setting how MFEs come about, as well as their potential dynamic consequences. Although the mechanism underlying MFEs cannot easily be captured by current population dynamics models, this phenomena should not be ignored during analysis; there is a growing body of evidence that such collaborative activity may be a key towards unlocking the possible functional properties of many neuronal networks.},

Emphasis is given to a phenomenon we call clustering, by which we refer to a tendency of random groups of neurons large and small to spontaneously coordinate their spiking activity in some fashion. Using a sparsely connected network of integrate-and-fire neurons, we demonstrate that spike clustering occurs ubiquitously in both high firing and low firing regimes. As a practical tool for quantifying such spike patterns, we propose a simple scheme with two parameters, one setting the temporal scale and the other the amount of deviation from the mean to be regarded as significant. Viewing population activity as a sequence of events, meaning relatively brief durations of elevated spiking, separated by inter-event times, we observe that background activity tends to give rise to extremely broad distributions of event sizes and inter-event times, while driving a system imposes a certain regularity on its inter-event times, producing a rhythm consistent with broad-band gamma oscillations. We note also that event sizes and inter-event times decorrelate very quickly. Dynamical analyses supported by numerical evidence are offered.},

In this paper, we identify a number of concrete dynamical scenarios in which a standard perturbative technique, based on the infinitesimal phase response curve (PRC), is shown to give different predictions than the full model. Shear-induced chaos, i.e., chaotic behavior that results from the amplification of small perturbations by underlying shear, is missed entirely by the PRC. We show also that the presence of “sticky” phase–space structures tend to cause perturbative techniques to overestimate the frequencies and regularity of the oscillations. The phenomena we describe can all be observed in a simple 2D neuron model, which we choose for illustration as the PRC is widely used in mathematical neuroscience.},

Reliability means that a signal elicits essentially identical responses upon repeated presentations, regardless of the network's initial condition. We study reliability on two distinct scales: neuronal reliability, which concerns the repeatability of spike times of individual neurons embedded within a network, and pooled-response reliability, which concerns the repeatability of total synaptic outputs from a subpopulation of the neurons in a network. We find that neuronal reliability depends strongly both on the overall architecture of a network, such as whether it is arranged into one or two layers, and on the strengths of the synaptic connections. Specifically, for the type of single-neuron dynamics and coupling considered, single-layer networks are found to be very reliable, while two-layer networks lose their reliability with the introduction of even a small amount of feedback. As expected, pooled responses for large enough populations become more reliable, even when individual neurons are not. We also study the effects of noise on reliability, and find that noise that affects all neurons similarly has much greater impact on reliability than noise that affects each neuron differently. Qualitative explanations are proposed for the phenomena observed.},

Using numerical and analytical methods, we investigate the effects of partially symmetric connectivity on the dynamics in networks of rate units. We consider the two dynamical regimes exhibited by random neural networks: the weak-coupling regime, where the firing activity decays to a single fixed point unless the network is stimulated, and the strong-coupling or chaotic regime, characterized by internally generated fluctuating firing rates. In the weak-coupling regime, we compute analytically, for an arbitrary degree of symmetry, the autocorrelation of network activity in the presence of external noise. In the chaotic regime, we perform simulations to determine the timescale of the intrinsic fluctuations. In both cases, symmetry increases the characteristic asymptotic decay time of the autocorrelation function and therefore slows down the dynamics in the network.},

We analyzed the hydraulic properties of the 35S::PME1 transgenic aspen that ectopically under- or over-express a xylem-abundant pectin methyl esterase, PtxtPME1. We also produced and analyzed 4CL1::PGII transgenic poplars expressing a fungal polygalacturonase, AnPGII, under the control of the Ptxa4CL1 promoter that is active in the developing xylem after xylem cell expansion. Both the 35S::PME1 under- and over-expressing aspen lines developed xylem with lower-specific hydraulic conductivity and lower VC, while the 4CL1::PGII plants developed xylem with a higher VC. These xylem hydraulic changes were associated with modifications in xylem structure or in intervessel pit structure that can result in changes in mechanical behavior of the pit membrane. This study shows that homogalacturonans and their methylation pattern influence xylem hydraulic properties, through its effect on xylem cell expansion and on intervessel pit properties and it show a role for PtxtPME1 in the xylem hydraulic properties.},

  abstract     = {The attractor neural network scenario is a popular scenario for memory storage in the association cortex, but there is still a large gap between models based on this scenario and experimental data. We study a recurrent network model in which both learning rules and distribution of stored patterns are inferred from distributions of visual responses for novel and familiar images in the inferior temporal cortex (ITC). Unlike classical attractor neural network models, our model exhibits graded activity in retrieval states, with distributions of firing rates that are close to lognormal. Inferred learning rules are close to maximizing the number of stored patterns within a family of unsupervised Hebbian learning rules, suggesting that learning rules in ITC are optimized to store a large number of attractor states. Finally, we show that there exist two types of retrieval states: one in which firing rates are constant in time and another in which firing rates fluctuate chaotically.},

Recent optogenetic studies on memory engram formation assign a critical role in learning to suprathreshold activation of neurons and their integration into active engrams ("engram cells"). Here we review evidence that ensemble integration may result from LTP but also from cell-autonomous changes in membrane excitability. We propose that synaptic plasticity determines synaptic connectivity maps, whereas intrinsic plasticity-possibly separated in time-amplifies neuronal responsiveness and acutely drives engram integration. Our proposal marks a move away from an exclusively synaptocentric toward a non-exclusive, neurocentric view of learning.},

Theoretical studies have shown that synaptic plasticity allows a network to store a memory of patterns of activity such that they become attractors of the dynamics of the network. Here we study the properties of the excitatory synaptic connectivity in a network that maximizes the number of stored patterns of activity in a robust fashion. We show that the resulting synaptic connectivity matrix has the following properties: it is sparse, with a large fraction of zero synaptic weights ('potential' synapses); bidirectionally coupled pairs of neurons are over-represented in comparison to a random network; and bidirectionally connected pairs have stronger synapses on average than unidirectionally connected pairs. All these features reproduce quantitatively available data on connectivity in cortex. This suggests synaptic connectivity in cortex is optimized to store a large number of attractor states in a robust fashion.},

In particular, a prominent aspect that remains debated is how the plasticity mechanisms, that encompass a broad spectrum of temporal and spatial scales, come to play together in a concerted fashion.

We investigated in rat cerebellar slices synaptic currents in Unipolar Brush Cells (UBCs), which generate intrinsic mossy fibers relaying vestibular inputs to the cerebellar cortex. We show that UBCs respond to sinusoidal modulations of their sensory input with heterogeneous amplitudes and phase shifts. Experiments and modeling indicate that this variability results both from the kinetics of synaptic glutamate transients and from the diversity of postsynaptic receptors. While phase inversion is produced by an mGluR2-activated outward conductance in OFF-UBCs, the phase delay of ON UBCs is caused by a late rebound current resulting from AMPAR recovery from desensitization. Granular layer network modeling indicates that phase dispersion of UBC responses generates diverse phase coding in the granule cell population, allowing climbing-fiber-driven Purkinje cell learning at arbitrary phases of the vestibular input.},

For a better understanding of grain dehydration, we evaluated the hypothesis that hydraulic conductance of the ear decreases during the latter stages of development and that this decrease results from disruption or occlusion of xylem conduits. Whole ear, rachis, and stem nodes hydraulic conductance and percentage loss of xylem conductivity were measured from flowering to harvest-ripeness on bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cv. Récital grown under controlled environments. Flag leaf transpiration, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content and grain and ear water potentials were also measured during grain development. We show that grain dehydration was not related with whole plant physiology and leaf senescence, but closely correlated with the hydraulic properties of the xylem conduits irrigating the grains. Indeed, there was a substantial decrease in rachis hydraulic conductance at the onset of the grain dehydration phase. This hydraulic impairment was not caused by the presence of air embolism in xylem conduits of the stem internodes or rachis but by the occlusion of the xylem lumens by polysaccharides (pectins and callose). Our results demonstrate that xylem hydraulics plays a key role during grain maturation.},

Previously, we have shown that the expression of PtaRHE1, encoding a Populus tremula × Populus alba RING-H2 protein with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, is associated with tissues undergoing secondary growth. To further elucidate the role of PtaRHE1 in vascular tissues, we have undertaken a reverse genetic analysis in poplar. Within stem secondary vascular tissues, PtaRHE1 and its corresponding protein are expressed predominantly in the phloem. The downregulation of PtaRHE1 in poplar by artificial miRNA triggers alterations in phloem fibre patterning, characterized by an increased portion of secondary phloem fibres that have a reduced cell wall thickness and a change in lignin composition, with lower levels of syringyl units as compared with wild-type plants. Following an RNA-seq analysis, a biological network involving hormone stress signalling, as well as developmental processes, could be delineated. Several candidate genes possibly associated with the altered phloem fibre phenotype observed in amiRPtaRHE1 poplar were identified. Altogether, our data suggest a regulatory role for PtaRHE1 in secondary phloem fibre development.},

Here, we characterize the patterns of activity that lead to postsynaptically expressed LTP using both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Similar to the requirements of LTD, we find that high-frequency bursts are necessary to trigger LTP and that this burst-dependent plasticity depends on presynaptic NMDA receptors and nitric oxide (NO) signaling. We provide direct evidence for calcium entry through presynaptic NMDA receptors in a subpopulation of parallel fiber varicosities. Finally, we develop and experimentally verify a mechanistic plasticity model based on NO and calcium signaling. The model reproduces plasticity outcomes from data and predicts the effect of arbitrary patterns of synaptic inputs on Purkinje cells, thereby providing a unified description of plasticity.},

The crucial parameters that control the retrieval abilities of the network are (1) the ratio between the number of synaptic contacts of long- and short-range origins (2) the number of categories in which a module is activated and (3) the amount of local inhibition.

However, neuronal populations subject to stochastic fluctuations can follow inputs beyond this limit. We investigated this apparent paradox theoretically and experimentally using Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, a motor structure that benefits from rapid information transfer. We analyzed the modulation of firing in response to the somatic injection of sinusoidal currents. Computational modeling suggested that, instead of decreasing with frequency, modulation amplitude can increase up to high frequencies because of cellular morphology. Electrophysiological measurements in adult rat slices confirmed this prediction and displayed a marked resonance at 200 Hz. We elucidated the underlying mechanism, showing that the two-compartment morphology of the Purkinje cell, interacting with a simple spiking mechanism and dendritic fluctuations, is sufficient to create high-frequency signal amplification. This mechanism, which we term morphology-induced resonance, is selective for somatic inputs, which in the Purkinje cell are exclusively inhibitory. The resonance sensitizes Purkinje cells in the frequency range of population oscillations observed in vivo.},

Data are from the SIGAL follow-up study. IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were measured in AD subjects who performed a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) every 6 months for 2 years. MMSE course was analyzed using a mixed model with random intercept and slope function. Among the 200 AD participants, 146 (mean age = 81.1 (standard deviation (SD) = 5.9) years, 62.6% of women) had at least one follow-up visit. Mean IGF-I at baseline was 147.8 (74.2) ng/mL. Hundred forty-six participants (62.6%) had at least one follow-up visit. Mean MMSE was 21.7 (4.7)/30 and dropped on average by 2.28 points per year. MMSE decline was steeper among participants with lower IGF-I. For each decrease of 1 SD of IGF-I, subjects lost an additional 0.63 points per year in MMSE, e.g., participants with IGF-I level of 74 ng/mL lost 2.91 MMSE points per year whereas participants with IGF-I of 222 ng/mL lost 1.65 MMSE points per year. There was no association between IGFBP-3 and cognitive decline. Lower baseline serum IGF-I was associated with faster cognitive decline in AD over a 2-year period.},

Here, we focus on two experimentally well-identified gliotransmitter pathways, (i) modulations of synaptic release and (ii) postsynaptic slow inward currents mediated by glutamate released from astrocytes, and investigate their possible functional relevance on synaptic plasticity in a biophysical model of an astrocyte-regulated synapse. Our model predicts that both pathways could profoundly affect both short- and long-term plasticity. In particular, activity-dependent glutamate release from astrocytes could dramatically change spike-timing-dependent plasticity, turning potentiation into depression (and vice versa) for the same induction protocol.},

  abstract        = {The local field potential (LFP) captures different neural processes, including integrative synaptic dynamics that cannot be observed by measuring only the spiking activity of small populations. Therefore, investigating how LFP power is modulated by external stimuli can offer important insights into sensory neural representations. However, gaining such insight requires developing data-driven computational models that can identify and disambiguate the neural contributions to the LFP. Here, we investigated how networks of excitatory and inhibitory integrate-and-fire neurons responding to time-dependent inputs can be used to interpret sensory modulations of LFP spectra. We computed analytically from such models the LFP spectra and the information that they convey about input and used these analytical expressions to fit the model to LFPs recorded in V1 of anesthetized macaques (Macaca mulatta) during the presentation of color movies. Our expressions explain 60%-98% of the variance of the LFP spectrum shape and its dependency upon movie scenes and we achieved this with realistic values for the best-fit parameters. In particular, synaptic best-fit parameters were compatible with experimental measurements and the predictions of firing rates, based only on the fit of LFP data, correlated with the multiunit spike rate recorded from the same location. Moreover, the parameters characterizing the input to the network across different movie scenes correlated with cross-scene changes of several image features. Our findings suggest that analytical descriptions of spiking neuron networks may become a crucial tool for the interpretation of field recordings.},

  abstract        = {Most models of learning and memory assume that memories are maintained in neuronal circuits by persistent synaptic modifications induced by specific patterns of pre- and postsynaptic activity. For this scenario to be viable, synaptic modifications must survive the ubiquitous ongoing activity present in neural circuits in vivo. In this paper, we investigate the time scales of memory maintenance in a calcium-based synaptic plasticity model that has been shown recently to be able to fit different experimental data-sets from hippocampal and neocortical preparations. We find that in the presence of background activity on the order of 1 Hz parameters that fit pyramidal layer 5 neocortical data lead to a very fast decay of synaptic efficacy, with time scales of minutes. We then identify two ways in which this memory time scale can be extended: (i) the extracellular calcium concentration in the experiments used to fit the model are larger than estimated concentrations in vivo. Lowering extracellular calcium concentration to in vivo levels leads to an increase in memory time scales of several orders of magnitude; (ii) adding a bistability mechanism so that each synapse has two stable states at sufficiently low background activity leads to a further boost in memory time scale, since memory decay is no longer described by an exponential decay from an initial state, but by an escape from a potential well. We argue that both features are expected to be present in synapses in vivo. These results are obtained first in a single synapse connecting two independent Poisson neurons, and then in simulations of a large network of excitatory and inhibitory integrate-and-fire neurons. Our results emphasise the need for studying plasticity at physiological extracellular calcium concentration, and highlight the role of synaptic bi- or multistability in the stability of learned synaptic structures.},

  abstract        = {Understanding the theoretical foundations of how memories are encoded and retrieved in neural populations is a central challenge in neuroscience. A popular theoretical scenario for modeling memory function is the attractor neural network scenario, whose prototype is the Hopfield model. The model simplicity and the locality of the synaptic update rules come at the cost of a poor storage capacity, compared with the capacity achieved with perceptron learning algorithms. Here, by transforming the perceptron learning rule, we present an online learning rule for a recurrent neural network that achieves near-maximal storage capacity without an explicit supervisory error signal, relying only upon locally accessible information. The fully-connected network consists of excitatory binary neurons with plastic recurrent connections and non-plastic inhibitory feedback stabilizing the network dynamics; the memory patterns to be memorized are presented online as strong afferent currents, producing a bimodal distribution for the neuron synaptic inputs. Synapses corresponding to active inputs are modified as a function of the value of the local fields with respect to three thresholds. Above the highest threshold, and below the lowest threshold, no plasticity occurs. In between these two thresholds, potentiation/depression occurs when the local field is above/below an intermediate threshold. We simulated and analyzed a network of binary neurons implementing this rule and measured its storage capacity for different sizes of the basins of attraction. The storage capacity obtained through numerical simulations is shown to be close to the value predicted by analytical calculations. We also measured the dependence of capacity on the strength of external inputs. Finally, we quantified the statistics of the resulting synaptic connectivity matrix, and found that both the fraction of zero weight synapses and the degree of symmetry of the weight matrix increase with the number of stored patterns.},

The objective of the study was to assess the relationship between IGF-I and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) serum levels and Hb, after adjustment especially for major nutritional factors in an elderly population because IGF-I system depends on nutritional state, often impaired in the elderly. Hemoglobin concentration was tested for 672 participants evaluated during an outpatient geriatric assessment. IGF-I and IGFBP-3 serum levels were assessed by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay. The molar ratio of IGF-I/IGFBP-3 that reflects the bioavailable IGF-I was calculated. Levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were plotted against quartiles of Hb. Final linear models for IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and ratio molar included factors that could modify the Hb level. Mean age (SD) of the sample was 78.0 (8.5) years old and 32% were men. After adjustment for age and sex, IGF-I serum level, IGFBP-3 serum level and molar ratio significantly increased with increasing quartiles of Hb. After adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, albumin, pre-albumin, renal function, total cholesterol, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers consumption, C-Reactive Protein, Hb was significantly associated and with IGF-I level (p = .002) and molar ratio (p = .02). IGF-I serum level and IGF-I/IGFBP-3 molar ratio were associated with Hb in an elderly population, independently of nutritional biological parameters. Thus, the association between the IGF-I system and Hb merits further investigation to determine whether interventions that modulate circulating IGF-I or IGF-I/BP3 ratio might preserve Hb in the elderly.},

In this cross-sectional study, 719 participants (mean age [SD] years: 78.2 [6.8]; 31.8% men) were evaluated during an outpatient geriatric assessment. AF was determined by electrocardiogram or medical record. Participants were classified into two groups: Participants with AF (n = 91) or without AF (n = 628).

After adjusting for confounding factors (age, gender, beta blocker medication, heart rate, hypertension, stroke, and chronic heart failure), low IGF-I serum level (OR [95% CI] = 0.66 [0.49-0.87]) and low IGFBP-3 serum level (0.71 [0.54-0.93]) remained independent determinants of AF. Low IGF-I and low IGFBP-3 serum levels were independently associated with AF in this elderly population.

The impact of IGF-1 in cardiovascular disease remains controversial. We therefore studied whether IGF-1 at admission for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) predicted death, recurrent AMI, and stroke over a 2-year follow-up. Using data from the French registry of Acute ST-elevation and non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction registry, we measured IGF-1 among all the 1005 patients with AMI who participated in the serum data bank. Because IGF-1 decreases with age, a standardized IGF-1 score was calculated as previously described [IGF-1 score = (log [IGF-1 (micrograms per liter)] + 0.00625 × age - 2.555)/0.104]. Impact of IGF-1 score (continuous and quartiles) on outcomes were compared using Cox proportional hazards regression models. During follow-up, 190 patients died or had a recurrent AMI or stroke. Patients in the lowest quartile of IGF-1 were older and more frequently female and diabetic compared with patients in the other quartiles. After adjustment for known cardiovascular factors, an increase of five units of IGF-1 score was associated with a 30% decrease of the risk of events during follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio 0.70; 95% confidence interval 0.54-0.92; P = .0093). Similarly, the lowest quartile of IGF-1 was associated with an increased risk of events (adjusted hazard ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 1.11-2.08; compared with others quartiles, P = .010). Low IGF-1 score is associated with an increased risk of all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction, and stroke in AMI patients. Whether patients treated by IGF-1 axis inhibitors have a specific clinical course after AMI would be worth studying.},

Immunogold labelling with transmission electron microscopy was carried out with a set of antibodies raised against different epitopes for each wall polysaccharide type and for lignins. Analyses were performed on both immature and mature vessels. The effect of sap ionic strength on xylem conductance was also tested. In mature vessels, the pit membrane (PM) was composed of crystalline cellulose and lignins. None of the hemicellulose epitopes were found in the PM. Pectin epitopes in mature vessels were highly concentrated in the annulus, a restricted area of the PM, whereas they were initially found in the whole PM in immature vessels. The pit border also showed a specific labelling pattern, with higher cellulose labelling compared with the secondary wall of the vessel. Ion-mediated variation of 24 % was found for hydraulic conductance. Cellulose microfibrils, lignins and annulus-restricted pectins have different physicochemical properties (rigidity, hydrophobicity, porosity) that have different effects on the hydraulic functions of the PM, and these influence both the hydraulic efficiency and vulnerability to cavitation of the pits, including ion-mediated control of hydraulic conductance. Impregnation of the cellulose microfibrils of the PM with lignins, which have low wettability, may result in lower cavitation pressure for a given pore size and thus help to explain the vulnerability of this species to cavitation.},

  abstract        = {Intervessel pits are structures that play a key role in the efficiency and safety functions of xylem hydraulics. However, little is known about the components of the pit membrane (PM) and their role in hydraulic functions, especially in resistance to cavitation. We tested the effect of commercial chemicals including a cellulase, a hemicellulase, a pectolyase, a proteinase and DTT on xylem hydraulic properties: vulnerability to cavitation (VC) and conductance. The effects were tested on branch segments from Fagus sylvatica (where the effects on pit structure were analyzed using TEM) and Populus tremula. Cellulose hydrolysis resulted in a sharp increase in VC and a significant increase in conductance, related to complete breakdown of the PM. Pectin hydrolysis also induced a sharp increase in VC but with no effect on conductance or pit structure observable by TEM. The other treatments with hemicellulase, proteinase or DTT showed no effect. This study brings evidence that cellulose and pectins are critical components underpinning VC, and that PM components may play distinct roles in the xylem hydraulic safety and efficiency.},

The storage capacity of such networks has been quantified in two ways: the maximal number of patterns that can be stored, and the stored information measured in bits per synapse. In this paper, we compute both quantities in fully connected networks of N binary neurons with binary synapses, storing patterns with coding level [Formula: see text], in the large [Formula: see text] and sparse coding limits ([Formula: see text]). We also derive finite-size corrections that accurately reproduce the results of simulations in networks of tens of thousands of neurons. These methods are applied to three different scenarios: (1) the classic Willshaw model, (2) networks with stochastic learning in which patterns are shown only once (one shot learning), (3) networks with stochastic learning in which patterns are shown multiple times. The storage capacities are optimized over network parameters, which allows us to compare the performance of the different models. We show that finite-size effects strongly reduce the capacity, even for networks of realistic sizes. We discuss the implications of these results for memory storage in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex.},

  abstract        = {Mechanisms of cerebellar motor learning are still poorly understood. The standard Marr-Albus-Ito theory posits that learning involves plasticity at the parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses under control of the climbing fiber input, which provides an error signal as in classical supervised learning paradigms. However, a growing body of evidence challenges this theory, in that additional sites of plasticity appear to contribute to motor adaptation. Here, we consider phase-reversal training of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), a simple form of motor learning for which a large body of experimental data is available in wild-type and mutant mice, in which the excitability of granule cells or inhibition of Purkinje cells was affected in a cell-specific fashion. We present novel electrophysiological recordings of Purkinje cell activity measured in naive wild-type mice subjected to this VOR adaptation task. We then introduce a minimal model that consists of learning at the parallel fibers to Purkinje cells with the help of the climbing fibers. Although the minimal model reproduces the behavior of the wild-type animals and is analytically tractable, it fails at reproducing the behavior of mutant mice and the electrophysiology data. Therefore, we build a detailed model involving plasticity at the parallel fibers to Purkinje cells' synapse guided by climbing fibers, feedforward inhibition of Purkinje cells, and plasticity at the mossy fiber to vestibular nuclei neuron synapse. The detailed model reproduces both the behavioral and electrophysiological data of both the wild-type and mutant mice and allows for experimentally testable predictions.},

Thirty-six percent of the identified proteins that were differentially expressed after gravistimulation were established as potential Thioredoxin targets. In addition, Thioredoxin h expression was induced following gravistimulation. In situ immunolocalization indicated that Thioredoxin h protein co-localized with the amyloplasts located in the endodermal cells.

The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between IGF-I and IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) serum levels and cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this multicentric cross-sectional study, 694 elderly subjects (218 men, 476 women; 78.6 ± 6.7 yr old) were included; 481 had memory complaints and were diagnosed, after comprehensive cognitive assessment, with AD (n = 224) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 257). The control group was comprised of 213 subjects without memory complaint and with normal cognition (recruited among patients' caregivers). IGF-I and IGFBP-3 serum levels were determined by ELISA. IGF-I and IGFBP-3 serum levels were significantly associated with cognitive status in men (IGF-I, 137 ± 69 ng/ml for AD vs. 178 ± 88 ng/ml for MCI and 172 ± 91 ng/ml for controls, P = 0.01; IGFBP-3, 3675 ± 1542 ng/ml for AD vs. 4143 ± 1828 ng/ml for MCI and 4488 ± 1893 ng/ml for controls, P = 0.04). In women, IGFBP-3 was significantly associated with cognitive status (3781 ± 1351 ng/ml for AD vs. 4190 ± 1408 ng/ml for MCI and 4390 ± 1552 ng/ml for controls; P < 0.001), but no significant differences between groups for IGF-I occurred. After adjustment for confounding variables (age, educational level, body mass index, diabetes, apolipoprotein E ε4 status), logistic regression indicated that IGF-I [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 0.48 (0.26-0.88)] and IGFBP-3 [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 0.71 (0.52-0.97)] serum levels were independently associated with AD in men, but not in women.

According to this theory, plasticity at the Parallel Fiber (PF) to Purkinje Cell (PC) synapses is guided by the Climbing fibers (CF), which encode an 'error signal'. Purkinje cells have thus been modeled as perceptrons, learning input/output binary associations. At maximal capacity, a perceptron with excitatory weights expresses a large fraction of zero-weight synapses, in agreement with experimental findings. However, numerous experiments indicate that the firing rate of Purkinje cells varies in an analog, not binary, manner. In this paper, we study the perceptron with analog inputs and outputs. We show that the optimal input has a sparse binary distribution, in good agreement with the burst firing of the Granule cells. In addition, we show that the weight distribution consists of a large fraction of silent synapses, as in previously studied binary perceptron models, and as seen experimentally.},

In many of those protocols, increases in postsynaptic calcium concentration have been shown to play a crucial role. However, it is still unclear whether and how the dynamics of the postsynaptic calcium alone determine the outcome of synaptic plasticity. Here, we propose a calcium-based model of a synapse in which potentiation and depression are activated above calcium thresholds. We show that this model gives rise to a large diversity of spike timing-dependent plasticity curves, most of which have been observed experimentally in different systems. It accounts quantitatively for plasticity outcomes evoked by protocols involving patterns with variable spike timing and firing rate in hippocampus and neocortex. Furthermore, it allows us to predict that differences in plasticity outcomes in different studies are due to differences in parameters defining the calcium dynamics. The model provides a mechanistic understanding of how various stimulation protocols provoke specific synaptic changes through the dynamics of calcium concentration and thresholds implementing in simplified fashion protein signaling cascades, leading to long-term potentiation and long-term depression. The combination of biophysical realism and analytical tractability makes it the ideal candidate to study plasticity at the synapse, neuron, and network levels.},

Because XIPs are still ranked as uncharacterized proteins, their further molecular characterization is required. Herein, a systematic fine-scale analysis of XIP sequences found in flowering plant databases revealed that XIPs are found in at least five groups. The phylogenetic relationship of these five groups with the phylogenetic organization of angiosperms revealed an original pattern of evolution for the XIP subfamily through distinct angiosperm taxon-specific clades. Of all flowering plant having XIPs, the genus Populus encompasses the broadest panel and the highest polymorphism of XIP isoforms, with nine PtXIP sequences distributed within three XIP groups. Comprehensive PtXIP gene expression patterns showed that only two isoforms (PtXIP2;1 and PtXIP3;2) were transcribed in vegetative tissues. However, their patterns are contrasted, PtXIP2;1 was ubiquitously accumulated whereas PtXIP3;2 was predominantly detected in wood and to a lesser extent in roots. Furthermore, only PtXIP2;1 exhibited a differential expression in leaves and stems of drought-, salicylic acid-, or wounding-challenged plants. Unexpectedly, the PtXIPs displayed different abilities to alter water transport upon expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes. PtXIP2;1 and PtXIP3;3 transported water while other PtXIPs did not.},

  abstract        = {The cerebellum has long been considered to undergo supervised learning, with climbing fibers acting as a 'teaching' or 'error' signal. Purkinje cells (PCs), the sole output of the cerebellar cortex, have been considered as analogs of perceptrons storing input/output associations. In support of this hypothesis, a recent study found that the distribution of synaptic weights of a perceptron at maximal capacity is in striking agreement with experimental data in adult rats. However, the calculation was performed using random uncorrelated inputs and outputs. This is a clearly unrealistic assumption since sensory inputs and motor outputs carry a substantial degree of temporal correlations. In this paper, we consider a binary output neuron with a large number of inputs, which is required to store associations between temporally correlated sequences of binary inputs and outputs, modelled as Markov chains. Storage capacity is found to increase with both input and output correlations, and diverges in the limit where both go to unity. We also investigate the capacity of a bistable output unit, since PCs have been shown to be bistable in some experimental conditions. Bistability is shown to enhance storage capacity whenever the output correlation is stronger than the input correlation. Distribution of synaptic weights at maximal capacity is shown to be independent on correlations, and is also unaffected by the presence of bistability.},

  abstract        = {How leaf shape is regulated is a long-standing question in botany. For diverse groups of dicotyledon species, lamina folding along the veins and geometry of the space available for the primordia can explain the palmate leaf morphology. Dubbed the kirigami theory, this hypothesis of fold-dependent leaf shape regulation has remained largely theoretical. Using Acer pseudoplatanus, we investigated the mechanisms behind the two key processes of kirigami leaf development. Cytological examination and quantitative analyses were used to examine the course of the vein-dependent lamina folding. Surgical ablation and tissue culturing were employed to test the effects of physical constraints on primordia growth. The final morphology of leaves growing without steric constraints were predicted mathematically. The cytological examination showed that the lamina's abaxial side along the veins grows substantially more than the adaxial side. The abaxial hypergrowth along the veins and the lamina extension correlated with the lamina folding. When a primordium was released from the physical constraints imposed by the other primordia, it rapidly grew into the newly available space, while maintaining the curvature inward. The morphology of such a leaf was predicted to lack symmetry in the lobe shapes. The enhanced growth on the abaxial side of the lamina along the veins is likely to drive lamina folding. The surgical ablation provided clear support for the space-filling nature of leaf growth; thus, steric constraints play a role in determination of the shapes of folded leaves and probably also of the final leaf morphology.},

  abstract        = {Quebrachitol is a cyclic polyol and, along with sucrose, is one of the main sugars in Hevea latex. However, in contrast to sucrose, the mechanism and regulation of quebrachitol absorption is still unknown. Screening a latex-derived cDNA library using polyol transporter-specific probes, two full-length cDNAs were isolated, and named HbPLT1 and HbPLT2 (for Hevea brasiliensis polyol transporter 1 and 2, respectively). Their respective sequences exhibited close similarity with the previously cloned acyclic sugar polyol transporters, and shared the main features of the major facilitative superfamily. The functional activity of one of the cDNAs was determined by using an HbPLT2-complemented yeast strain. These strains displayed a marginal absorption of cyclic (inositol) and acyclic (mannitol and sorbitol) polyol but no absorption of sucrose, hexose and glycerol. Active absorption for xylitol was detected, and was competitively inhibited by quebrachitol. HbPLT1 and HbPLT2 expression patterns varied in response to different stimuli. Bark treatment with ethylene resulted in an early and significant up-regulation of HbPLT2 transcripts in laticifers as well as in inner bark cells, when compared with HbPLT1. Other treatments, especially mechanical wounding, strongly induced HbPLT2 transcripts. These data were consistent with the presence of ethylene and a wound-responsive regulatory cis-element on the sequence of the HbPLT2 promoter. All these findings together with those recently obtained for sucrose transporters and aquaporins are discussed in relation to the different roles for quebrachitol in Hevea brasiliensis.},

We start by discussing simple models in which plasticity changes are based directly on calcium amplitude and dynamics. We then consider models in which dynamic intracellular signaling cascades form the link between the calcium dynamics and the plasticity changes.

  abstract        = {High firing irregularity is a hallmark of cortical neurons in vivo, and modeling studies suggest a balance of excitation and inhibition is necessary to explain this high irregularity. Such a balance must be generated, at least partly, from local interconnected networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but the details of the local network structure are largely unknown. The dynamics of the neural activity depends on the local network structure; this in turn suggests the possibility of estimating network structure from the dynamics of the firing statistics. Here we report a new method to estimate properties of the local cortical network from the instantaneous firing rate and irregularity (CV(2)) under the assumption that recorded neurons are a part of a randomly connected sparse network. The firing irregularity, measured in monkey motor cortex, exhibits two features; many neurons show relatively stable firing irregularity in time and across different task conditions; the time-averaged CV(2) is widely distributed from quasi-regular to irregular (CV(2) = 0.3-1.0). For each recorded neuron, we estimate the three parameters of a local network [balance of local excitation-inhibition, number of recurrent connections per neuron, and excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) size] that best describe the dynamics of the measured firing rates and irregularities. Our analysis shows that optimal parameter sets form a two-dimensional manifold in the three-dimensional parameter space that is confined for most of the neurons to the inhibition-dominated region. High irregularity neurons tend to be more strongly connected to the local network, either in terms of larger EPSP and inhibitory PSP size or larger number of recurrent connections, compared with the low irregularity neurons, for a given excitatory/inhibitory balance. Incorporating either synaptic short-term depression or conductance-based synapses leads many low CV(2) neurons to move to the excitation-dominated region as well as to an increase of EPSP size.},

  abstract        = {Hevea brasiliensis is an important industrial crop for natural rubber production. Latex biosynthesis occurs in the cytoplasm of highly specialized latex cells and requires sucrose as the unique precursor. Ethylene stimulation of latex production results in high sugar flow from the surrounding cells of inner bark towards the latex cells. The aim of this work was to understand the role of seven sucrose transporters (HbSUTs) and one hexose transporter (HbHXT1) in this process. Two Hevea clones were used: PB217 and PB260, respectively described as high and low yielding clones. The expression pattern of these sugar transporters (HbSUTs and HbHXT1) was monitored under different physiological conditions and found to be maximal in latex cells. HbSUT1, one of the most abundant isoforms, displayed the greatest response to ethylene treatment. In clone PB217, ethylene treatment led to a higher accumulation of HbSUT1B in latex cells than in the inner bark tissues. Conversely, stronger expression of HbSUT1B was observed in inner bark tissues than in latex cells of PB260. A positive correlation with HbSUT1B transcript accumulation and increased latex production was further supported by its lower expression in latex cells of the virgin clone PB217.},

Such experiments have revealed a rich phenomenology on how reaction times depend on various factors such as strength and nature of associations, time intervals between stimulus presentations, and so forth. Experimental protocols on humans present striking similarities with pair association task experiments in monkeys. Electrophysiological recordings of cortical neurons in such tasks have found two types of task-related activity, "retrospective" (related to a previously shown stimulus), and "prospective" (related to a stimulus that the monkey expects to appear, due to learned association between both stimuli). Mathematical models of cortical networks allow theorists to understand the link between the physiology of single neurons and synapses, and network behavior giving rise to retrospective and/or prospective activity. Here, we show that this type of network model can account for a large variety of priming effects. Furthermore, the model allows us to interpret semantic priming differences between the two hemispheres as depending on a single association strength parameter.},

It is therefore essential to understand quantitatively how CCFs are shaped by different factors, such as connectivity, synaptic parameters, and background activity. Here, we study the CCF between two neurons using analytical calculations and numerical simulations. We quantify the role of synaptic parameters, such as peak conductance, decay time, and reversal potential, and analyze how various patterns of connectivity influence CCF shapes. In particular, we find that the symmetry of the CCF distinguishes in general, but not always, the case of shared inputs between two neurons from the case in which they are directly synaptically connected. We systematically examine the influence of background synaptic inputs from the surrounding network that set the baseline firing statistics of the neurons and modulate their response properties. We find that variations in the background noise modify the amplitude of the cross-correlation function as strongly as variations of synaptic strength. In particular, we show that the postsynaptic neuron spiking regularity has a pronounced influence on CCF amplitude. This suggests an efficient and flexible mechanism for modulating functional interactions.},

Yet, the role of this kind of activity in encoding sensory information remains largely unknown. To understand the rules of translation between the structure of sensory stimuli and the fluctuations of cortical responses, we simulated a sparsely connected network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons modeling a local cortical population, and we determined how the LFPs generated by the network encode information about input stimuli. We first considered simple static and periodic stimuli and then naturalistic input stimuli based on electrophysiological recordings from the thalamus of anesthetized monkeys watching natural movie scenes. We found that the simulated network produced stimulus-related LFP changes that were in striking agreement with the LFPs obtained from the primary visual cortex. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the network encoded static input spike rates into gamma-range oscillations generated by inhibitory-excitatory neural interactions and encoded slow dynamic features of the input into slow LFP fluctuations mediated by stimulus-neural interactions. The model cortical network processed dynamic stimuli with naturalistic temporal structure by using low and high response frequencies as independent communication channels, again in agreement with recent reports from visual cortex responses to naturalistic movies. One potential function of this frequency decomposition into independent information channels operated by the cortical network may be that of enhancing the capacity of the cortical column to encode our complex sensory environment.},

  abstract        = {Calcium imaging of the spontaneous activity in cortical slices has revealed repeating spatiotemporal patterns of transitions between so-called down states and up states (Ikegaya et al., 2004). Here we fit a model network of stochastic binary neurons to data from these experiments, and in doing so reproduce the distributions of such patterns. We use two versions of this model: (1) an unconnected network in which neurons are activated as independent Poisson processes; and (2) a network with an interaction matrix, estimated from the data, representing effective interactions between the neurons. The unconnected model (model 1) is sufficient to account for the statistics of repeating patterns in 11 of the 15 datasets studied. Model 2, with interactions between neurons, is required to account for pattern statistics of the remaining four. Three of these four datasets are the ones that contain the largest number of transitions, suggesting that long datasets are in general necessary to render interactions statistically visible. We then study the topology of the matrix of interactions estimated for these four datasets. For three of the four datasets, we find sparse matrices with long-tailed degree distributions and an overrepresentation of certain network motifs. The remaining dataset exhibits a strongly interconnected, spatially localized subgroup of neurons. In all cases, we find that interactions between neurons facilitate the generation of long patterns that do not repeat exactly.},

  abstract     = {Persistent activity observed in neurophysiological experiments in monkeys is thought to be the neuronal correlate of working memory. Over the last decade, network modellers have strived to reproduce the main features of these experiments. In particular, attractor network models have been proposed in which there is a coexistence between a non-selective attractor state with low background activity with selective attractor states in which sub-groups of neurons fire at rates which are higher (but not much higher) than background rates. A recent detailed statistical analysis of the data seems however to challenge such attractor models: the data indicates that firing during persistent activity is highly irregular (with an average CV larger than 1), while models predict a more regular firing process (CV smaller than 1). We discuss here recent proposals that allow to reproduce this feature of the experiments.},

These experiments show that during the delay period the coefficient of variation (CV) of interspike intervals (ISI) of prefrontal neurons is above 1, on average, and larger than during the fixation period. In the present paper, we show that this feature can be reproduced in a network in which persistent activity is induced by excitatory feedback, provided that (i) the post-spike reset is close enough to threshold , (ii) synaptic efficacies are a non-linear function of the pre-synaptic firing rate. Non-linearity between pre-synaptic rate and effective synaptic strength is implemented by a standard short-term depression mechanism (STD). First, we consider the simplest possible network with excitatory feedback: a fully connected homogeneous network of excitatory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, using both numerical simulations and analytical techniques. The results are then confirmed in a network with selective excitatory neurons and inhibition. In both the cases there is a large range of values of the synaptic efficacies for which the statistics of firing of single cells is similar to experimental data.},

However, biological systems considered as dynamical, non-linear and generally partially observed processes may be difficult to estimate even if the structure of interactions is given. Using the same approach as Sitz et al. proposed in another context, we derive non-linear state-space models from ODEs describing biological networks. In this framework, we apply Unscented Kalman Filtering (UKF) to the estimation of both parameters and hidden variables of non-linear state-space models. We instantiate the method on a transcriptional regulatory model based on Hill kinetics and a signaling pathway model based on mass action kinetics. We successfully use synthetic data and experimental data to test our approach. This approach covers a large set of biological networks models and gives rise to simple and fast estimation algorithms. Moreover, the Bayesian tool used here directly provides uncertainty estimates on parameters and hidden states. Let us also emphasize that it can be coupled with structure inference methods used in Graphical Probabilistic Models. Matlab code available on demand.},

  abstract        = {The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays a key role in the induction of long-term postsynaptic modifications following calcium entry. Experiments suggest that these long-term synaptic changes are all-or-none switch-like events between discrete states. The biochemical network involving CaMKII and its regulating protein signaling cascade has been hypothesized to durably maintain the evoked synaptic state in the form of a bistable switch. However, it is still unclear whether experimental LTP/LTD protocols lead to corresponding transitions between the two states in realistic models of such a network. We present a detailed biochemical model of the CaMKII autophosphorylation and the protein signaling cascade governing the CaMKII dephosphorylation. As previously shown, two stable states of the CaMKII phosphorylation level exist at resting intracellular calcium concentration, and high calcium transients can switch the system from the weakly phosphorylated (DOWN) to the highly phosphorylated (UP) state of the CaMKII (similar to a LTP event). We show here that increased CaMKII dephosphorylation activity at intermediate Ca(2+) concentrations can lead to switching from the UP to the DOWN state (similar to a LTD event). This can be achieved if protein phosphatase activity promoting CaMKII dephosphorylation activates at lower Ca(2+) levels than kinase activity. Finally, it is shown that the CaMKII system can qualitatively reproduce results of plasticity outcomes in response to spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and presynaptic stimulation protocols. This shows that the CaMKII protein network can account for both induction, through LTP/LTD-like transitions, and storage, due to its bistability, of synaptic changes.},

Learning in systems with discrete synapses is known to be a computationally hard problem. Here, we study a neurobiologically plausible on-line learning algorithm that derives from belief propagation algorithms. We show that it performs remarkably well in a model neuron with binary synapses, and a finite number of "hidden" states per synapse, that has to learn a random classification task. Such a system is able to learn a number of associations close to the theoretical limit in time that is sublinear in system size. This is to our knowledge the first on-line algorithm that is able to achieve efficiently a finite number of patterns learned per binary synapse. Furthermore, we show that performance is optimal for a finite number of hidden states that becomes very small for sparse coding. The algorithm is similar to the standard "perceptron" learning algorithm, with an additional rule for synaptic transitions that occur only if a currently presented pattern is "barely correct." In this case, the synaptic changes are metaplastic only (change in hidden states and not in actual synaptic state), stabilizing the synapse in its current state. Finally, we show that a system with two visible states and K hidden states is much more robust to noise than a system with K visible states. We suggest that this rule is sufficiently simple to be easily implemented by neurobiological systems or in hardware.},

  abstract        = {We performed extracellular recording of pairs of interneuron-Purkinje cells in vivo. A single interneuron produces a substantial, short-lasting, inhibition of Purkinje cells. Feed-forward inhibition is associated with characteristic asymmetric cross-correlograms. In vivo, Purkinje cell spikes only depend on the most recent synaptic activity. Cerebellar molecular layer interneurons are considered to control the firing rate and spike timing of Purkinje cells. However, interactions between these cell types are largely unexplored in vivo. Using tetrodes, we performed simultaneous extracellular recordings of neighbouring Purkinje cells and molecular layer interneurons, presumably basket cells, in adult rats in vivo. The high levels of afferent synaptic activity encountered in vivo yield irregular spiking and reveal discharge patterns characteristic of feed-forward inhibition, thus suggesting an overlap of the afferent excitatory inputs between Purkinje cells and basket cells. Under conditions of intense background synaptic inputs, interneuron spikes exert a short-lasting inhibitory effect, delaying the following Purkinje cell spike by an amount remarkably independent of the Purkinje cell firing cycle. This effect can be explained by the short memory time of the Purkinje cell potential as a result of the intense incoming synaptic activity. Finally, we found little evidence for any involvement of the interneurons that we recorded with the cerebellar high-frequency oscillations promoting Purkinje cell synchrony. The rapid interactions between interneurons and Purkinje cells might be of particular importance in fine motor control because the inhibitory action of interneurons on Purkinje cells leads to deep cerebellar nuclear disinhibition and hence increased cerebellar output.},

  abstract        = {The formation and stability of synapses are key questions in neuroscience. Post-synaptic domains have been classically conceived as resulting from local insertion and turnover of proteins at the synapse. However, insertion is likely to occur outside the post-synaptic domains and advances in single-molecule imaging have shown that proteins diffuse in the plane of the membrane prior to their accumulation at synapses. We quantitatively investigated this scenario using computer simulations and mathematical analysis, taking for definiteness the specific case of inhibitory synapse components, i.e., the glycine receptor (GlyR) and the associated gephyrin scaffolding protein. The observed domain sizes of scaffold clusters can be explained by a dynamic balance between the aggregation of gephyrin proteins diffusing while bound to GlyR and their turnover at the neuron membrane. We also predict the existence of extrasynaptic clusters with a characteristic size distribution that significantly contribute to the size fluctuations of synaptic domains. New super-resolution data for gephyrin proteins established the existence of extrasynaptic clusters the sizes of which are consistent with the model predictions in a range of model parameters. At a general level, our results highlight aggregation with removal as a non-equilibrium phase separation which produces structures of tunable size.},

Inside the bulk we include velocity alignment interactions between neighboring cells. At the border contour of the layer we introduce the following additional forces: surface-elasticity restoring force, curvature-dependent positive feedback, and contractile acto-myosin cables.

Using microarray experiments, we found 761 genes under the control of both Six and MyoD. Using MyoD ChIPseq data and a genome-wide search for Six1/4 MEF3 binding sites, we found significant co-localization of binding sites for MyoD and Six proteins on over a thousand mouse genomic DNA regions. The combination of both datasets yielded 82 genes which are synergistically activated by Six and MyoD, with 96 associated MyoD+MEF3 putative cis-regulatory modules (CRMs). Fourteen out of 19 of the CRMs that we tested demonstrated in Luciferase assays a synergistic action also observed for their cognate gene. We searched putative binding sites on these CRMs using available databases and de novo search of conserved motifs and demonstrated that the Six/MyoD synergistic activation takes place in a feedforward way. It involves the recruitment of these two families of transcription factors to their targets, together with partner transcription factors, encoded by genes that are themselves activated by Six and MyoD, including Mef2, Pbx-Meis and EBF.},

  abstract        = {The identification of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) on genomic DNA is of crucial importance for understanding and predicting regulatory elements in gene networks. TFBS motifs are commonly described by Position Weight Matrices (PWMs), in which each DNA base pair contributes independently to the transcription factor (TF) binding. However, this description ignores correlations between nucleotides at different positions, and is generally inaccurate: analysing fly and mouse in vivo ChIPseq data, we show that in most cases the PWM model fails to reproduce the observed statistics of TFBSs. To overcome this issue, we introduce the pairwise interaction model (PIM), a generalization of the PWM model. The model is based on the principle of maximum entropy and explicitly describes pairwise correlations between nucleotides at different positions, while being otherwise as unconstrained as possible. It is mathematically equivalent to considering a TF-DNA binding energy that depends additively on each nucleotide identity at all positions in the TFBS, like the PWM model, but also additively on pairs of nucleotides. We find that the PIM significantly improves over the PWM model, and even provides an optimal description of TFBS statistics within statistical noise. The PIM generalizes previous approaches to interdependent positions: it accounts for co-variation of two or more base pairs, and predicts secondary motifs, while outperforming multiple-motif models consisting of mixtures of PWMs. We analyse the structure of pairwise interactions between nucleotides, and find that they are sparse and dominantly located between consecutive base pairs in the flanking region of TFBS. Nonetheless, interactions between pairs of non-consecutive nucleotides are found to play a significant role in the obtained accurate description of TFBS statistics. The PIM is computationally tractable, and provides a general framework that should be useful for describing and predicting TFBSs beyond PWMs.},

Here we present Imogene, an ensemble of statistical tools that we have developed to facilitate their identification and implemented in a publicly available software. Starting from a small training set of mammalian or fly CRMs that drive similar gene expression profiles, Imogene determines de novo cis-regulatory motifs that underlie this co-expression. It can then predict on a genome-wide scale other CRMs with a regulatory potential similar to the training set. Imogene bypasses the need of large datasets for statistical analyses by making central use of the information provided by the sequenced genomes of multiple species, based on the developed statistical tools and explicit models for transcription factor binding site evolution. We test Imogene on characterized tissue-specific mouse developmental CRMs. Its ability to identify CRMs with the same specificity based on its de novo created motifs is comparable to that of previously evaluated 'motif-blind' methods. We further show, both in flies and in mammals, that Imogene de novo generated motifs are sufficient to discriminate CRMs related to different developmental programs. Notably, purely relying on sequence data, Imogene performs as well in this discrimination task as a previously reported learning algorithm based on Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data for multiple transcription factors at multiple developmental stages.},

In embryos, epithelial sheets serve as versatile substrates during the formation of developing organs. Some aspects of epithelial morphogenesis can be adequately described using vertex models, in which the two-dimensional arrangement of epithelial cells is approximated by a polygonal lattice with an energy that has contributions reflecting the properties of individual cells and their interactions. Previous studies with such models have largely focused on dynamics confined to two spatial dimensions and analyzed them numerically. We show how these models can be extended to account for three-dimensional deformations and studied analytically. Starting from the extended model, we derive a continuum plate description of cell sheets, in which the effective tissue properties, such as bending rigidity, are related explicitly to the parameters of the vertex model. To derive the continuum plate model, we duly take into account a microscopic shift between the two sublattices of the hexagonal network, which has been ignored in previous work. As an application of the continuum model, we analyze tissue buckling by a line tension applied along a circular contour, a simplified set-up relevant to several situations in the developmental contexts. The buckling thresholds predicted by the continuum description are in good agreement with the results of stability calculations based on the vertex model. Our results establish a direct connection between discrete and continuum descriptions of cell sheets and can be used to probe a wide range of morphogenetic processes in epithelial tissues.},

  abstract        = {Developmental programs are implemented by regulatory interactions between Transcription Factors (TFs) and their target genes, which remain poorly understood. While recent studies have focused on regulatory cascades of TFs that govern early development, little is known about how the ultimate effectors of cell differentiation are selected and controlled. We addressed this question during late Drosophila embryogenesis, when the finely tuned expression of the TF Ovo/Shavenbaby (Svb) triggers the morphological differentiation of epidermal trichomes. We defined a sizeable set of genes downstream of Svb and used in vivo assays to delineate 14 enhancers driving their specific expression in trichome cells. Coupling computational modeling to functional dissection, we investigated the regulatory logic of these enhancers. Extending the repertoire of epidermal effectors using genome-wide approaches showed that the regulatory models learned from this first sample are representative of the whole set of trichome enhancers. These enhancers harbor remarkable features with respect to their functional architectures, including a weak or non-existent clustering of Svb binding sites. The in vivo function of each site relies on its intimate context, notably the flanking nucleotides. Two additional cis-regulatory motifs, present in a broad diversity of composition and positioning among trichome enhancers, critically contribute to enhancer activity. Our results show that Svb directly regulates a large set of terminal effectors of the remodeling of epidermal cells. Further, these data reveal that trichome formation is underpinned by unexpectedly diverse modes of regulation, providing fresh insights into the functional architecture of enhancers governing a terminal differentiation program.},

Here, we tackle this question in the controlled setting where the motion of Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells in a confluent epithelium is triggered by the unmasking of free surface. We develop a simple model in which cells are described as point particles with a dynamic based on the two premises that, first, cells move in a stochastic manner and, second, tend to adapt their motion to that of their neighbors. Detailed comparison to experimental data show that the model provides a quantitatively accurate description of cell motion in the epithelium bulk at early times. In addition, inclusion of model "leader" cells with modified characteristics, accounts for the digitated shape of the interface which develops over the subsequent hours, providing that leader cells invade free surface more easily than other cells and coordinate their motion with their followers. The previously-described progression of the epithelium border is reproduced by the model and quantitatively explained.},

Here, we investigate the possible structures of bistable genetic networks that can allow two identical cells to acquire different fates through cell-cell interactions. Cell-autonomous bistable networks have been previously sampled using an evolutionary algorithm. We extend this evolutionary procedure to take into account interactions between cells. We obtain a variety of simple bistable networks that we classify into major subtypes. Some have long been proposed in the context of lateral inhibition through the Notch-Delta pathway, some have been more recently considered and others appear to be new and based on mechanisms not previously considered. The results highlight the role of posttranscriptional interactions and particularly of protein complexation and sequestration, which can replace cooperativity in transcriptional interactions. Some bistable networks are entirely based on posttranscriptional interactions and the simplest of these is found to lead, upon a single parameter change, to oscillations in the two cells with opposite phases. We provide qualitative explanations as well as mathematical analyses of the dynamical behaviors of various created networks. The results should help to identify and understand genetic structures implicated in cell-cell interactions and differentiation.},

These programs result from the interpretation of the genomic cis-regulatory information by sequence-specific factors. Decoding this information in sequenced genomes is an important issue. Here, we developed statistical analysis tools to computationally identify the cis-regulatory elements that control gene expression in a set of coregulated genes. Starting with a small number of validated and/or predicted cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in a reference species as a training set, but with no a priori knowledge of the factors acting in trans, we computationally predicted transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and genomic CRMs underlying coregulation. This method was applied to the gene expression program active in Drosophila melanogaster sensory organ precursor cells (SOPs), a specific type of neural progenitor cells. Mutational analysis showed that four, including one newly characterized, out of the five top-ranked families of predicted TFBSs were required for SOP-specific gene expression. Additionaly, 19 out of the 29 top-ranked predicted CRMs directed gene expression in neural progenitor cells, i.e., SOPs or larval brain neuroblasts, with a notable fraction active in SOPs (11/29). We further identified the lola gene as the target of two SOP-specific CRMs and found that the lola gene contributed to SOP specification. The statistics and phylogeny-based tools described here can be more generally applied to identify the cis-regulatory elements of specific gene regulatory networks in any family of related species with sequenced genomes.},

We evolved in silico regulatory networks by a mutation/selection process that just rewards the number of segment boundaries. For segmentation controlled by a static gradient, as in long-germ band insects, a cascade of adjacent repressors reminiscent of gap genes evolves. For sequential segmentation controlled by a moving gradient, similar to vertebrate somitogenesis, we invariably observe a very constrained evolutionary path or funnel. The evolved state is a cell autonomous 'clock and wavefront' model, with the new attribute of a separate bistable system driven by an autonomous clock. Early stages in the evolution of both modes of segmentation are functionally similar, and simulations suggest a possible path for their interconversion. Our computation illustrates how complex traits can evolve by the incremental addition of new functions on top of pre-existing traits.},

The activity becomes oscillatory when the inhibitory feedback is strong enough. The period of the global oscillation is found to be mainly controlled by synaptic times but depends also on the characteristics of the external input. In large but finite networks, the analysis shows that global oscillations of finite coherence time generically exist both above and below the critical inhibition threshold. Their characteristics are determined as functions of systems parameters in these two different regions. The results are found to be in good agreement with numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Electrophysiological recordings in cortex in vivo have revealed a rich variety of dynamical regimes ranging from irregular asynchronous states to a diversity of synchronized states, depending on species, anesthesia, and external stimulation. The average population firing rate in these states is typically low. We study analytically and numerically a network of sparsely connected excitatory and inhibitory integrate-and-fire neurons in the inhibition-dominated, low firing rate regime. For sufficiently high values of the external input, the network exhibits an asynchronous low firing frequency state (L). Depending on synaptic time constants, we show that two scenarios may occur when external inputs are decreased: (1) the L state can destabilize through a Hopf bifucation as the external input is decreased, leading to synchronized oscillations spanning d δ to β frequencies; (2) the network can reach a bistable region, between the low firing frequency network state (L) and a quiescent one (Q). Adding an adaptation current to excitatory neurons leads to spontaneous alternations between L and Q states, similar to experimental observations on UP and DOWN states alternations.},

  abstract     = {Human efficiency in processing incoming stimuli (in terms of speed and/or accuracy) is typically enhanced by previous exposure to the same, or closely related stimuli-a phenomenon referred to as priming. In spite of the large body of knowledge accumulated in behavioral studies about the conditions conducive to priming, and its relationship with other forms of memory, the underlying neuronal correlates of priming are still under debate. The idea has repeatedly been advanced that a major neuronal mechanism supporting behaviorally-expressed priming is repetition suppression, a widespread reduction of spiking activity upon stimulus repetition which has been routinely exposed by single-unit recordings in non-human primates performing delayed-response, as well as passive fixation tasks. This proposal is mainly motivated by the observation that, in human fMRI studies, priming is associated to a significant reduction of the BOLD signal (widely interpreted as a proxy of the level of spiking activity) upon stimulus repetition. Here, we critically re-examine a large part of the electrophysiological literature on repetition suppression in non-human primates and find that repetition suppression is systematically accompanied by stimulus-selective delay period activity, together with repetition enhancement, an increase of spiking activity upon stimulus repetition in small neuronal populations. We argue that repetition enhancement constitutes a more viable candidate for a putative neuronal substrate of priming, and propose a minimal framework that links together, mechanistically and functionally, repetition suppression, stimulus-selective delay activity and repetition enhancement.},

The mechanistic and functional relationship between these two basic neurophysiological signatures of working memory remains elusive. We propose that match signals are generated as a result of transient changes in local network excitability brought about by persistent activity. Neurons more active will be more excitable, and thus more responsive to external inputs. Accordingly, network responses are jointly determined by the incoming stimulus and the ongoing pattern of persistent activity. Using a spiking model network, we show that this mechanism is able to reproduce most of the experimental phenomenology of match effects as exposed by single-cell recordings during delayed-response tasks. The model provides a unified, parsimonious mechanistic account of the main neuronal correlates of working memory, makes several experimentally testable predictions, and demonstrates a new functional role for persistent activity.},

We recorded Local Field Potentials (LFPs) and spiking activity from V1 of anaesthetized macaques during binocular presentation of Hollywood color movies. We analyzed these recordings with information theoretic methods, and found that visual information was encoded mainly by two bands of LFP responses: the network fluctuations measured by the phase and power of low-frequency (less than 12 Hz) LFPs; and fast gamma-range (50-100 Hz) oscillations. Both the power and phase of low frequency LFPs carried information largely complementary to that carried by spikes, whereas gamma range oscillations carried information largely redundant to that of spikes. To interpret these results within a quantitative theoretical framework, we then simulated a sparsely connected recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons receiving slowly varying naturalistic inputs, and we determined how the LFPs generated by the network encoded information about the inputs. We found that this simulated recurrent network reproduced well the experimentally observed dependency of LFP information upon frequency. This network encoded the overall strength of the input into the power of gamma-range oscillations generated by inhibitory-excitatory neural interactions, and encoded slow variations in the input by entraining the network LFP at the corresponding frequency. This dynamical behavior accounted quantitatively for the independent information carried by high and low frequency LFPs, and for the experimentally observed cross-frequency coupling between phase of slow LFPs and the power of gamma LFPs. We also present new results showing that the model's dynamics also accounted for the extra visual information that the low-frequency LFP phase of spike firing carries beyond that carried by spike rates. Overall, our results suggest biological mechanisms by which cortex can multiplex information about naturalistic sensory environments.},

  abstract        = {Despite the widespread use of EEGs to measure the large-scale dynamics of the human brain, little is known on how the dynamics of EEGs relates to that of the underlying spike rates of cortical neurons. However, progress was made by recent neurophysiological experiments reporting that EEG delta-band phase and gamma-band amplitude reliably predict some complementary aspects of the time course of spikes of visual cortical neurons. To elucidate the mechanisms behind these findings, here we hypothesize that the EEG delta phase reflects shifts of local cortical excitability arising from slow fluctuations in the network input due to entrainment to sensory stimuli or to fluctuations in ongoing activity, and that the resulting local excitability fluctuations modulate both the spike rate and the engagement of excitatory-inhibitory loops producing gamma-band oscillations. We quantitatively tested these hypotheses by simulating a recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons stimulated with dynamic inputs presenting temporal regularities similar to that of thalamic responses during naturalistic visual stimulation and during spontaneous activity. The network model reproduced in detail the experimental relationships between spike rate and EEGs, and suggested that the complementariness of the prediction of spike rates obtained from EEG delta phase or gamma amplitude arises from nonlinearities in the engagement of excitatory-inhibitory loops and from temporal modulations in the amplitude of the network input, which respectively limit the predictability of spike rates from gamma amplitude or delta phase alone. The model suggested also ways to improve and extend current algorithms for online prediction of spike rates from EEGs.},

Recent work shows that neural responses at different timescales can encode different stimulus attributes, resulting in a temporal multiplexing of sensory information. Multiplexing increases the encoding capacity of neural responses, enables disambiguation of stimuli that cannot be discriminated at a single response timescale, and makes sensory representations stable to the presence of variability in the sensory world. Thus, as we discuss here, temporal multiplexing could be a key strategy used by the brain to form an information-rich and stable representation of the environment.},

  abstract        = {Neurons transform time-varying inputs into action potentials emitted stochastically at a time dependent rate. The mapping from current input to output firing rate is often represented with the help of phenomenological models such as the linear-nonlinear (LN) cascade, in which the output firing rate is estimated by applying to the input successively a linear temporal filter and a static non-linear transformation. These simplified models leave out the biophysical details of action potential generation. It is not a priori clear to which extent the input-output mapping of biophysically more realistic, spiking neuron models can be reduced to a simple linear-nonlinear cascade. Here we investigate this question for the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF), exponential integrate-and-fire (EIF) and conductance-based Wang-Buzsáki models in presence of background synaptic activity. We exploit available analytic results for these models to determine the corresponding linear filter and static non-linearity in a parameter-free form. We show that the obtained functions are identical to the linear filter and static non-linearity determined using standard reverse correlation analysis. We then quantitatively compare the output of the corresponding linear-nonlinear cascade with numerical simulations of spiking neurons, systematically varying the parameters of input signal and background noise. We find that the LN cascade provides accurate estimates of the firing rates of spiking neurons in most of parameter space. For the EIF and Wang-Buzsáki models, we show that the LN cascade can be reduced to a firing rate model, the timescale of which we determine analytically. Finally we introduce an adaptive timescale rate model in which the timescale of the linear filter depends on the instantaneous firing rate. This model leads to highly accurate estimates of instantaneous firing rates.},

We introduce a method that allows one to infer the dependence of the presumptive learning rule on postsynaptic firing rate, and we show that the inferred learning rule exhibits depression for low postsynaptic rates and potentiation for high rates. The threshold separating depression from potentiation is strongly correlated with both mean and s.d. of the firing rate distribution. Finally, we show that network models implementing a rule extracted from data show stable learning dynamics and lead to sparser representations of stimuli.},

The dynamics is characterized by the network dynamical transfer function, i.e., how the population firing rate is modulated by sinusoidal inputs at arbitrary frequencies. Two types of networks are studied and compared: (i) a Wilson-Cowan type firing rate model; and (ii) a fully connected network of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, in a strong noise regime. We first characterize the region of stability of the "asynchronous state" (a state in which population activity is constant in time when external inputs are constant) in the space of parameters characterizing the connectivity of the network. We then systematically characterize the qualitative behaviors of the dynamical transfer function, as a function of the connectivity. We find that the transfer function can be either low-pass, or with a single or double resonance, depending on the connection strengths and synaptic time constants. Resonances appear when the system is close to Hopf bifurcations, that can be induced by two separate mechanisms: the I-I connectivity and the E-I connectivity. Double resonances can appear when excitatory delays are larger than inhibitory delays, due to the fact that two distinct instabilities exist with a finite gap between the corresponding frequencies. In networks of LIF neurons, changes in external inputs and external noise are shown to be able to change qualitatively the network transfer function. Firing rate models are shown to exhibit the same diversity of transfer functions as the LIF network, provided delays are present. They can also exhibit input-dependent changes of the transfer function, provided a suitable static non-linearity is incorporated.},

  abstract     = {Computational models offer a unique tool for understanding the network-dynamical mechanisms which mediate between physiological and biophysical properties, and behavioral function. A traditional challenge in computational neuroscience is, however, that simple neuronal models which can be studied analytically fail to reproduce the diversity of electrophysiological behaviors seen in real neurons, while detailed neuronal models which do reproduce such diversity are intractable analytically and computationally expensive. A number of intermediate models have been proposed whose aim is to capture the diversity of firing behaviors and spike times of real neurons while entailing the simplest possible mathematical description. One such model is the exponential integrate-and-fire neuron with spike rate adaptation (aEIF) which consists of two differential equations for the membrane potential (V) and an adaptation current (w). Despite its simplicity, it can reproduce a wide variety of physiologically observed spiking patterns, can be fit to physiological recordings quantitatively, and, once done so, is able to predict spike times on traces not used for model fitting. Here we compute the steady-state firing rate of aEIF in the presence of Gaussian synaptic noise, using two approaches. The first approach is based on the 2-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation that describes the (V,w)-probability distribution, which is solved using an expansion in the ratio between the time constants of the two variables. The second is based on the firing rate of the EIF model, which is averaged over the distribution of the w variable. These analytically derived closed-form expressions were tested on simulations from a large variety of model cells quantitatively fitted to in vitro electrophysiological recordings from pyramidal cells and interneurons. Theoretical predictions closely agreed with the firing rate of the simulated cells fed with in-vivo-like synaptic noise.},

  abstract        = {The distribution of in vivo average firing rates within local cortical networks has been reported to be highly skewed and long tailed. The distribution of average single-cell inputs, conversely, is expected to be Gaussian by the central limit theorem. This raises the issue of how a skewed distribution of firing rates might result from a symmetric distribution of inputs. We argue that skewed rate distributions are a signature of the nonlinearity of the in vivo f-I curve. During in vivo conditions, ongoing synaptic activity produces significant fluctuations in the membrane potential of neurons, resulting in an expansive nonlinearity of the f-I curve for low and moderate inputs. Here, we investigate the effects of single-cell and network parameters on the shape of the f-I curve and, by extension, on the distribution of firing rates in randomly connected networks.},

Most of models have considered balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons in which AI states are sustained through recurrent sparse connectivity, with or without external input. In this letter we propose a mesoscopic description of such AI states. Using master equation formalism, we derive a second-order mean-field set of ordinary differential equations describing the temporal evolution of randomly connected balanced networks. This formalism takes into account finite size effects and is applicable to any neuron model as long as its transfer function can be characterized. We compare the predictions of this approach with numerical simulations for different network configurations and parameter spaces. Considering the randomly connected network as a unit, this approach could be used to build large-scale networks of such connected units, with an aim to model activity states constrained by macroscopic measurements, such as voltage-sensitive dye imaging.},

  abstract     = {We initiate a mathematical analysis of hidden effects induced by binning spike trains of neurons. Assuming that the original spike train has been generated by a discrete Markov process, we show that binning generates a stochastic process that is no longer Markov but is instead a variable-length Markov chain (VLMC) with unbounded memory. We also show that the law of the binned raster is a Gibbs measure in the DLR (Dobrushin-Lanford-Ruelle) sense coined in mathematical statistical mechanics. This allows the derivation of several important consequences on statistical properties of binned spike trains. In particular, we introduce the DLR framework as a natural setting to mathematically formalize anticipation, that is, to tell "how good" our nervous system is at making predictions. In a probabilistic sense, this corresponds to condition a process by its future, and we discuss how binning may affect our conclusions on this ability. We finally comment on the possible consequences of binning in the detection of spurious phase transitions or in the detection of incorrect evidence of criticality.},

Using a large-scale, high-density multielectrode array, we recorded from hundreds to thousands of RGCs simultaneously at pan-retinal level, including dorsal and ventral locations. Responses to different contrasts not only revealed a complex developmental profile for ON, OFF and ON-OFF responses, but also unveiled differences between dorsal and ventral RGC responses. At eye-opening, dorsal RGCs of all types were more responsive to light, perhaps indicating an environmental priority to nest viewing for pre-weaning pups. The developmental profile of ON and OFF responses exhibited antagonistic behaviour, with the strongest ON responses shortly after eye-opening, followed by an increase in the strength of OFF responses later on. Further, we found that with maturation receptive field (RF) center sizes decrease, spike-triggered averaged responses to white noise become stronger, and centers become more circular while maintaining differences between RGC types. We conclude that the maturation of retinal functionality is not spatially homogeneous, likely reflecting ecological requirements that favour earlier maturation of the dorsal retina.},

The maximum-entropy approach has been successfully used to characterize the statistical response of simultaneously recorded spiking neurons responding to stimuli. However, in spite of good performance in terms of prediction, the fitting parameters do not explain the underlying mechanistic causes of the observed correlations. On the other hand, mathematical models of spiking neurons (neuromimetic models) provide a probabilistic mapping between the stimulus, network architecture, and spike patterns in terms of conditional probabilities. In this paper we build an exact analytical mapping between neuromimetic and maximum-entropy models.},

  abstract        = {Homeostatic intrinsic plasticity (HIP) is a ubiquitous cellular mechanism regulating neuronal activity, cardinal for the proper functioning of nervous systems. In invertebrates, HIP is critical for orchestrating stereotyped activity patterns. The functional impact of HIP remains more obscure in vertebrate networks, where higher order cognitive processes rely on complex neural dynamics. The hypothesis has emerged that HIP might control the complexity of activity dynamics in recurrent networks, with important computational consequences. However, conflicting results about the causal relationships between cellular HIP, network dynamics, and computational performance have arisen from machine-learning studies. Here, we assess how cellular HIP effects translate into collective dynamics and computational properties in biological recurrent networks. We develop a realistic multiscale model including a generic HIP rule regulating the neuronal threshold with actual molecular signaling pathways kinetics, Dale's principle, sparse connectivity, synaptic balance, and Hebbian synaptic plasticity (SP). Dynamic mean-field analysis and simulations unravel that HIP sets a working point at which inputs are transduced by large derivative ranges of the transfer function. This cellular mechanism ensures increased network dynamics complexity, robust balance with SP at the edge of chaos, and improved input separability. Although critically dependent upon balanced excitatory and inhibitory drives, these effects display striking robustness to changes in network architecture, learning rates, and input features. Thus, the mechanism we unveil might represent a ubiquitous cellular basis for complex dynamics in neural networks. Understanding this robustness is an important challenge to unraveling principles underlying self-organization around criticality in biological recurrent neural networks.},

We consider the deterministic evolution of a time-discretized network with spiking neurons, where synaptic transmission has delays, modeled as a neural network of the generalized integrate and fire type. Our approach aims at by-passing the fact that the parameter estimation in SNN results in a non-deterministic polynomial-time hard problem when delays are to be considered. Here, this assumption has been reformulated as a linear programming (LP) problem in order to perform the solution in a polynomial time. Besides, the LP problem formulation makes the fact that the reverse engineering of a neural network can be performed from the observation of the spike times explicit. Furthermore, we point out how the LP adjustment mechanism is local to each neuron and has the same structure as a 'Hebbian' rule. Finally, we present a generalization of this approach to the design of input-output (I/O) transformations as a practical method to 'program' a spiking network, i.e. find a set of parameters allowing us to exactly reproduce the network output, given an input. Numerical verifications and illustrations are provided.},

Our goal is a better understanding of the extent to which computing and modeling with spiking neuron networks might be biologically plausible and computationally efficient. We intentionally restrict ourselves to a deterministic implementation of spiking neuron networks and we consider that the dynamics of a network is defined by a non-stochastic mapping. By staying in this rather simple framework, we are able to propose results, formula and concrete numerical values, on several topics: (i) general time constraints, (ii) links between continuous signals and spike trains, (iii) spiking neuron networks parameter adjustment. Beside an argued review of several facts and issues about neural coding by spikes, we propose new results, such as a numerical evaluation of the most critical temporal variables that schedule the progress of realistic spike trains. When implementing spiking neuron networks, for biological simulation or computational purpose, it is important to take into account the indisputable facts here unfolded. This precaution could prevent one from implementing mechanisms that would be meaningless relative to obvious time constraints, or from artificially introducing spikes when continuous calculations would be sufficient and more simple. It is also pointed out that implementing a large-scale spiking neuron network is finally a simple task.},

  abstract     = {We deal with the problem of bridging the gap between two scales in neuronal modeling. At the first (microscopic) scale, neurons are considered individually and their behavior described by stochastic differential equations that govern the time variations of their membrane potentials. They are coupled by synaptic connections acting on their resulting activity, a nonlinear function of their membrane potential. At the second (mesoscopic) scale, interacting populations of neurons are described individually by similar equations. The equations describing the dynamical and the stationary mean-field behaviors are considered as functional equations on a set of stochastic processes. Using this new point of view allows us to prove that these equations are well-posed on any finite time interval and to provide a constructive method for effectively computing their unique solution. This method is proved to converge to the unique solution and we characterize its complexity and convergence rate. We also provide partial results for the stationary problem on infinite time intervals. These results shed some new light on such neural mass models as the one of Jansen and Rit (1995): their dynamics appears as a coarse approximation of the much richer dynamics that emerges from our analysis. Our numerical experiments confirm that the framework we propose and the numerical methods we derive from it provide a new and powerful tool for the exploration of neural behaviors at different scales.},

Previous numerical work has reported that Hebbian learning drives the system from chaos to a steady state through a sequence of bifurcations. Here, we interpret these results mathematically and show that these effects, involving a complex coupling between neuronal dynamics and synaptic graph structure, can be analyzed using Jacobian matrices, which introduce both a structural and a dynamical point of view on neural network evolution. Furthermore, we show that sensitivity to a learned pattern is maximal when the largest Lyapunov exponent is close to 0. We discuss how neural networks may take advantage of this regime of high functional interest.},

We furthermore consider that the neuron dynamics may occur at a (shorter) time scale than synaptic plasticity and consider the possibility of learning rules with passive forgetting. We show that the application of such Hebbian learning leads to drastic changes in the network dynamics and structure. In particular, the learning rule contracts the norm of the weight matrix and yields a rapid decay of the dynamics complexity and entropy. In other words, the network is rewired by Hebbian learning into a new synaptic structure that emerges with learning on the basis of the correlations that progressively build up between neurons. We also observe that, within this emerging structure, the strongest synapses organize as a small-world network. The second effect of the decay of the weight matrix spectral radius consists in a rapid contraction of the spectral radius of the Jacobian matrix. This drives the system through the "edge of chaos" where sensitivity to the input pattern is maximal. Taken together, this scenario is remarkably predicted by theoretical arguments derived from dynamical systems and graph theory.},

Then, we show examples where, with a suitable choice of the carrier frequency (resonance), one can transmit a signal from a node to another one by amplitude modulation, in spite of chaos. Also, we give an example where a signal, transmitted to any node via different paths, can only be recovered by a couple of specific nodes. This opens up the possibility for encoding data in a way such that the recovery of the signal requires the knowledge of the carrier frequency and can be performed only at some specific node.},

We study the dynamics of a non-convergent recurrent model-the random recurrent neural networks. In that model a mean-field theory can be used to analyze the autonomous dynamics. We extend this approach with various observations on significant changes in the dynamical regime when sending static random stimuli. Then we propose a Hebb-like learning rule, viewed as a self-organization dynamical process inducing specific reactivity to one random stimulus. We numerically show the dynamics reduction during learning and recognition processes and analyze it in terms of dynamical repartition of local neural activity.},

This task required directional adjustments through spontaneous turning, while unexpected visual offset perturbations prompted induced turning. We found that M1 is essential for execution and learning of this visually guided task. Turn-selective layer 2/3 and layer 5 pyramidal tract (PT) neuron activation was shaped differentially with learning but scaled linearly with turn acceleration during spontaneous turns. During induced turns, however, layer 2/3 neurons were activated independent of behavioral response, while PT neurons still encoded behavioral response magnitude.

Using repeated in vivo two-photon imaging, we find that increases in spine size are tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) dependent and thus are likely associated with synaptic scaling. Rather than occurring at all spines, the observed increases in spine size are spatially localized to a subset of dendritic branches and are correlated with the degree of recent local spine loss within that branch. Using simulations, we show that such a compartmentalized form of synaptic scaling has computational benefits over cell-wide scaling for information processing within the cell.},

  abstract        = {The cortex is organized as a hierarchical processing structure. Feedback from higher levels of the hierarchy, known as top-down signals, have been shown to be involved in attentional and contextual modulation of sensory responses. Here we argue that top-down input to the primary visual cortex (V1) from A24b and the adjacent secondary motor cortex (M2) signals a prediction of visual flow based on motor output. A24b/M2 sends a dense and topographically organized projection to V1 that targets most neurons in layer 2/3. By imaging the activity of A24b/M2 axons in V1 of mice learning to navigate a 2D virtual environment, we found that their activity was strongly correlated with locomotion and resulting visual flow feedback in an experience-dependent manner. When mice were trained to navigate a left-right inverted virtual environment, correlations of neural activity with behavior reversed to match visual flow. These findings are consistent with a predictive coding interpretation of visual processing.},

Using a virtual reality system, we reared mice in conditions of normal or random visuomotor coupling. We recorded the activity of identified excitatory and inhibitory L2/3 neurons in response to transient visuomotor mismatches in both groups of mice. Mismatch responses in excitatory neurons were strongly experience dependent and driven by a transient release from inhibition mediated by somatostatin-positive interneurons. These data are consistent with a model in which L2/3 of V1 computes a difference between an inhibitory visual input and an excitatory locomotion-related input, where the balance between these two inputs is finely tuned by visuomotor experience.},

We found that a subset of V1 neurons exhibited responses that were predictive of the upcoming visual stimulus in a spatially dependent manner and that the omission of an expected stimulus drove strong responses in V1. Stimulus-predictive responses also emerged in V1-projecting anterior cingulate cortex axons, suggesting that anterior cingulate cortex serves as a source of predictions of visual input to V1. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that visual cortex forms an internal representation of the visual scene based on spatial location and compares this representation with feed-forward visual input.},

This activity can be modeled using a visual receptive field. In addition to visually driven activity, there are neurons in visual cortex that integrate visual and motor-related input to signal a mismatch between actual and predicted visual flow. Here we show that these mismatch neurons have receptive fields and signal a local mismatch between actual and predicted visual flow in restricted regions of visual space. These mismatch receptive fields are aligned to the retinotopic map of visual cortex and are similar in size to visual receptive fields. Thus, neurons with mismatch receptive fields signal local deviations of actual visual flow from visual flow predicted based on self-motion and could therefore underlie the detection of objects moving relative to the visual flow caused by self-motion.

We study this question in the nucleus interface of the nidopallium (NIf), which is required for normal birdsong production and provides the main source of auditory input to HVC, the driver of adult song. In juvenile and adult zebra finches, we find that spikes in NIf projection neurons precede vocalizations by several tens of milliseconds and are insensitive to distortions of auditory feedback. We identify a local isometry between NIf output and vocalizations: quasi-identical notes produced in different syllables are preceded by highly similar NIf spike patterns. NIf multiunit firing during song precedes responses in auditory cortical neurons by about 50 ms, revealing delayed congruence between NIf spiking and a neural representation of auditory feedback. Our findings suggest that NIf codes for imminent acoustic events within vocal performance.},

  abstract        = {Neurodegenerative processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) affect the structure and function of neurons [1-4], resulting in altered neuronal activity patterns comprising neuronal hypo- and hyperactivity [5, 6] and causing the disruption of long-range projections [7, 8]. Impaired information processing between functionally connected brain areas is evident in defective visuomotor integration, an early sign of the disease [9-11]. The cellular and neuronal circuit mechanisms underlying this disruption of information processing in AD, however, remain elusive. Recent studies in mice suggest that visuomotor integration already occurs in primary visual cortex (V1), as it not only processes sensory input but also exhibits strong motor-related activity, likely driven by neuromodulatory or excitatory inputs [12-17]. Here, we probed the integration of visual-and motor-related-inputs in V1 of behaving APP/PS1 [18] mice, a well-characterized mouse model of AD, using two-photon calcium imaging. We find that sensorimotor signals in APP/PS1 mice are differentially affected: while visually driven and motor-related signals are strongly reduced, neuronal responses signaling a mismatch between expected and actual visual flow are selectively spared. We furthermore observe an increase in aberrant activity during quiescent states in APP/PS1 mice. Jointly, the reduction in running-correlated activity and the enhanced aberrant activity degrade the coding accuracy of the network, indicating that the impairment of visuomotor integration in AD is already taking place at early stages of visual processing.},

Improvements in behavioral performance were closely associated with increasingly distinguishable population-level representations of task-relevant stimuli, as a result of stabilization of existing and recruitment of new neurons selective for these stimuli. These effects correlated with the appearance of multiple task-dependent signals during learning: those that increased neuronal selectivity across the population when expert animals engaged in the task, and those reflecting anticipation or behavioral choices specifically in neuronal subsets preferring the rewarded stimulus. Therefore, learning engages diverse mechanisms that modify sensory and non-sensory representations in V1 to adjust its processing to task requirements and the behavioral relevance of visual stimuli.},

We found that only a fraction of excitatory neurons homeostatically recover activity after deprivation and inhibitory neurons show no recovery. Prior to deprivation, excitatory cells that did recover were more likely to have significantly correlated activity with other recovering excitatory neurons, thus forming a subnetwork of recovering neurons. These network level changes are accompanied by a reduction in synaptic inhibition onto all excitatory neurons, suggesting that both synaptic mechanisms and subnetwork activity are important for homeostatic recovery of activity after deprivation.},

However, neurons that respond to auditory feedback from vocal output have not been found in song-control areas despite intensive searching. Here we investigate feedback processing outside the traditional song system, in single auditory forebrain neurons of juvenile zebra finches that were in a late developmental stage of song learning. Overall, we found similarity of spike responses during singing and during playback of the bird's own song, with song responses commonly leading by a few milliseconds. However, brief time-locked acoustic perturbations of auditory feedback revealed complex sensitivity that could not be predicted from passive playback responses. Some neurons that responded to playback perturbations did not respond to song perturbations, which is reminiscent of sensory-motor mirror neurons. By contrast, some neurons were highly feedback sensitive in that they responded vigorously to song perturbations, but not to unperturbed songs or perturbed playback. These findings suggest that a computational function of forebrain auditory areas may be to detect errors between actual feedback and mirrored feedback deriving from an internal model of the bird's own song or that of its tutor. Such feedback-sensitive spikes could constitute the key signals that trigger adaptive motor responses to song disruptions or reinforce exploratory motor gestures for vocal learning.},

  abstract        = {To generate complex bilateral motor patterns such as those underlying birdsong, neural activity must be highly coordinated across the two cerebral hemispheres. However, it remains largely elusive how this coordination is achieved given that interhemispheric communication between song-control areas in the avian cerebrum is restricted to projections received from bilaterally connecting areas in the mid- and hindbrain. By electrically stimulating cerebral premotor areas in zebra finches, we find that behavioral effectiveness of stimulation rapidly switches between hemispheres. In time intervals in which stimulation in one hemisphere tends to distort songs, stimulation in the other hemisphere is mostly ineffective, revealing an idiosyncratic form of motor dominance that bounces back and forth between hemispheres like a virtual ping-pong ball. The intervals of lateralized effectiveness are broadly distributed and are unrelated to simple spectral and temporal song features. Such interhemispheric switching could be an important dynamical aspect of neural coordination that may have evolved from simpler pattern generator circuits.},

  abstract        = {Dopamine midbrain neurons within the substantia nigra are particularly prone to degeneration in Parkinson's disease. Their selective loss causes the major motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, but the causes for the high vulnerability of SN DA neurons, compared to neighbouring, more resistant ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons, are still unclear. Consequently, there is still no cure available for Parkinson's disease. Current therapies compensate the progressive loss of dopamine by administering its precursor l-DOPA and/or dopamine D2-receptor agonists. D2-autoreceptors and Cav1.3-containing L-type Ca(2+) channels both contribute to Parkinson's disease pathology. L-type Ca(2+) channel blockers protect SN DA neurons from degeneration in Parkinson's disease and its mouse models, and they are in clinical trials for neuroprotective Parkinson's disease therapy. However, their physiological functions in SN DA neurons remain unclear. D2-autoreceptors tune firing rates and dopamine release of SN DA neurons in a negative feedback loop through activation of G-protein coupled potassium channels (GIRK2, or KCNJ6). Mature SN DA neurons display prominent, non-desensitizing somatodendritic D2-autoreceptor responses that show pronounced desensitization in PARK-gene Parkinson's disease mouse models. We analysed surviving human SN DA neurons from patients with Parkinson's disease and from controls, and detected elevated messenger RNA levels of D2-autoreceptors and GIRK2 in Parkinson's disease. By electrophysiological analysis of postnatal juvenile and adult mouse SN DA neurons in in vitro brain-slices, we observed that D2-autoreceptor desensitization is reduced with postnatal maturation. Furthermore, a transient high-dopamine state in vivo, caused by one injection of either l-DOPA or cocaine, induced adult-like, non-desensitizing D2-autoreceptor responses, selectively in juvenile SN DA neurons, but not ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons. With pharmacological and genetic tools, we identified that the expression of this sensitized D2-autoreceptor phenotype required Cav1.3 L-type Ca(2+) channel activity, internal Ca(2+), and the interaction of the neuronal calcium sensor NCS-1 with D2-autoreceptors. Thus, we identified a first physiological function of Cav1.3 L-type Ca(2+) channels in SN DA neurons for homeostatic modulation of their D2-autoreceptor responses. L-type Ca(2+) channel activity however, was not important for pacemaker activity of mouse SN DA neurons. Furthermore, we detected elevated substantia nigra dopamine messenger RNA levels of NCS-1 (but not Cav1.2 or Cav1.3) after cocaine in mice, as well as in remaining human SN DA neurons in Parkinson's disease. Thus, our findings provide a novel homeostatic functional link in SN DA neurons between Cav1.3- L-type-Ca(2+) channels and D2-autoreceptor activity, controlled by NCS-1, and indicate that this adaptive signalling network (Cav1.3/NCS-1/D2/GIRK2) is also active in human SN DA neurons, and contributes to Parkinson's disease pathology. As it is accessible to pharmacological modulation, it provides a novel promising target for tuning substantia nigra dopamine neuron activity, and their vulnerability to degeneration.},

  abstract        = {There is strong evidence that the core deficits of schizophrenia result from dysfunction of the dopamine (DA) system, but details of this dysfunction remain unclear. We previously reported a model of transgenic mice that selectively and reversibly overexpress DA D2 receptors (D2Rs) in the striatum (D2R-OE mice). D2R-OE mice display deficits in cognition and motivation that are strikingly similar to the deficits in cognition and motivation observed in patients with schizophrenia. Here, we show that in vivo, both the firing rate (tonic activity) and burst firing (phasic activity) of identified midbrain DA neurons are impaired in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), but not in the substantia nigra (SN), of D2R-OE mice. Normalizing striatal D2R activity by switching off the transgene in adulthood recovered the reduction in tonic activity of VTA DA neurons, which is concordant with the rescue in motivation that we previously reported in our model. On the other hand, the reduction in burst activity was not rescued, which may be reflected in the observed persistence of cognitive deficits in D2R-OE mice. We have identified a potential molecular mechanism for the altered activity of DA VTA neurons in D2R-OE mice: a reduction in the expression of distinct NMDA receptor subunits selectively in identified mesolimbic DA VTA, but not nigrostriatal DA SN, neurons. These results suggest that functional deficits relevant for schizophrenia symptoms may involve differential regulation of selective DA pathways.},

Cell-selective silencing of K-ATP channel activity in medial SN DA neurons revealed that their K-ATP channel-gated burst firing was crucial for novelty-dependent exploratory behavior.

In dopaminergic neurons, prominent patterns include repetitive, oscillatory bursts, regular pacemakers, and irregular spike trains with nonstationary properties. In order to describe and measure the variability of these patterns, we describe burstiness and regularity in a single model framework. We present a doubly stochastic spike train model in which a background oscillation with independent and normally distributed intervals gives rise to either single spikes or bursty spike events with Gaussian firing intensities. Five easily interpretable parameters allow a classification into bursty or single spike and irregularly or regularly oscillating firing patterns. This classification is based primarily on features of the autocorrelation histogram which are usually studied qualitatively by visual inspection. The present model provides a quantitative and objective classification scheme and relates these features directly to the underlying processes. In addition, confidence intervals visualize the uncertainty of parameter estimation and classification precision. We apply the model to a data set obtained from single dopaminergic substantia nigra neurons recorded extracellularly in vivo. The model is able to represent a high variety of discharge patterns observed empirically, and the classification agrees closely with visual inspection. In addition, changes in the parameters can be studied quantitatively, including also the properties related to bursting behavior. Thus, the proposed model can be used for the description of neuronal firing patterns and the investigation of their dynamical changes with cellular and experimental conditions.},

However, in contrast to the vast amounts of somatosensory information channeled by limbs to the brain, current BMIs are devoid of touch and force sensors. Patients must therefore rely solely on vision and audition, which are maladapted to the control of a prosthesis. In contrast, in a healthy limb, somatosensory inputs alone can efficiently guide the handling of a fragile object, or ensure a smooth trajectory. We have developed a BMI in the mouse that includes a rich artificial somatosensory-like cortical feedback. Our setup includes online recordings of the activity of multiple neurons in the whisker primary motor cortex (vM1) and delivers feedback simultaneously via a low-latency, high-refresh-rate, spatially structured photo-stimulation of the whisker primary somatosensory cortex (vS1), based on a mapping obtained by intrinsic imaging. We demonstrate the operation of the loop and show that mice can detect the neuronal spiking in vS1 triggered by the photo-stimulations. Finally, we show that the mice can learn a behavioral task relying solely on the artificial inputs and outputs of the closed-loop BMI. This is the first motor BMI that includes a short-latency, intracortical, somatosensory-like feedback. It will be a useful platform to discover efficient cortical feedback schemes towards future human BMI applications.},

Although it is known that neurons in secondary somatosensory cortex (wS2) respond to individual deflections of many whiskers, wS2's precise function remains unknown. The convergence of information from multiple whiskers into wS2 neurons suggests that they are good candidates for integrating multi-whisker information. Here, we apply stimulation patterns with rich dynamics simultaneously to 24 macro-vibrissae of rats while recording large populations of single neurons. Varying inter-whisker correlations without changing single whisker statistics, we observe pronounced supra-linear multi-whisker integration. Using novel analysis methods, we show that continuous multi-whisker movements contribute to the firing of wS2 neurons over long temporal windows, facilitating spatio-temporal integration. In contrast, primary cortex (wS1) neurons encode fine features of whisker movements on precise temporal scales. These results provide the first description of wS2's representation during multi-whisker stimulation and outline its specialized role in parallel to wS1 tactile processing.},

Cortical neuronal networks can extract global properties of tactile scenes. In the primary somatosensory cortex, the information relative to the global direction of a spatiotemporal sequence of whisker deflections can be extracted at the single neuron level. To further understand how the cortical network integrates multi-whisker inputs, we imaged and recorded the mouse barrel cortex activity evoked by sequences of multi-whisker deflections generating global motions in different directions. A majority of barrel-related cortical columns show a direction preference for global motions with an overall preference for caudo-ventral directions. Responses to global motions being highly sublinear, the identity of the first deflected whiskers is highly salient but does not seem to determine the global direction preference. Our results further demonstrate that the global direction preference is spatially organized throughout the barrel cortex at a supra-columnar scale.},

Still, views of the sensory representation of whisker information are increasingly shifting from a labeled line representation of single-whisker deflections to a selectivity for specific elements of the complex statistics of the multi-whisker deflection patterns that take place during spontaneous rodent behavior - so called natural tactile scenes. Here we review the current knowledge regarding the coding of patterns of whisker stimuli by barrel cortex neurons, from responses to single-whisker deflections to the representation of complex tactile scenes. A number of multi-whisker tunings have already been identified, including center-surround feature extraction, angular tuning during edge-like multi-whisker deflections, and even tuning to specific statistical properties of the tactile scene such as the level of correlation across whiskers. However, a more general model of the representation of multi-whisker information in the barrel cortex is still missing. This is in part because of the lack of a human intuition regarding the perception emerging from a whisker system, but also because in contrast to other primary sensory cortices such as the visual cortex, the spatial feature selectivity of barrel cortex neurons rests on highly nonlinear interactions that remained hidden to classical receptive field approaches.},

To address this, we recorded the activity of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) GABAergic neurons identified from a larger population of fast-spiking units and putative excitatory regular-spiking units in layer 5 of the mouse forelimb M1 during an M1-dependent, sensory-triggered reaching task. PV+ neurons showed short latency responses to the acoustic cue and vibrotactile trigger stimulus and an increase in firing at reaching onset that scaled with the amplitude of reaching. Unexpectedly, PV+ neurons fired before regular-spiking units at reach onset and showed high overall firing rates during both sensory-triggered and spontaneous reaches. Our data suggest that increasing M1 PV+ neuron firing rates may play a role in the initiation of voluntary reaching.},

Movement is transformed into electrical signals via the gating of mechanically activated ion channels at sensory endings in the skin. The sensitivity of Piezo mechanically gated ion channels is controlled by stomatin-like protein-3 (STOML3), which is required for normal mechanoreceptor function. Here we identify small-molecule inhibitors of STOML3 oligomerization that reversibly reduce the sensitivity of mechanically gated currents in sensory neurons and silence mechanoreceptors in vivo. STOML3 inhibitors in the skin also reversibly attenuate fine touch perception in normal mice. Under pathophysiological conditions following nerve injury or diabetic neuropathy, the slightest touch can produce pain, and here STOML3 inhibitors can reverse mechanical hypersensitivity. Thus, small molecules applied locally to the skin can be used to modulate touch and may represent peripherally available drugs to treat tactile-driven pain following neuropathy.},

In fact, two-photon targeted, dual whole-cell recordings showed that principal whisker stimulation elicits similar amplitude synaptic responses in fosGFP-expressing and fosGFP(-) neurons. FosGFP(+) neurons instead displayed shorter latency and larger amplitude subthreshold responses to surround whisker stimulation. Using optogenetic stimulation, we determined that these neurons are targeted by axons from the posteromedial nucleus (POm), a paralemniscal thalamic nucleus associated with broad receptive fields and widespread cortical projections.

Several tens of whiskers (or vibrissae) are distributed in a regular manner on both sides of the snout. Many tactile discrimination tasks using this system need multiple contacts with more than one whisker to be solved. With the aim of mimicking those multi-whisker stimuli during electrophysiological recordings, we developed a novel mechanical stimulator composed of 24 independent multi-directional piezoelectric benders adapted to the five rows and the five caudal arcs of the rat whisker pad. The most widely used technology for producing mechanical deflections of the whiskers is based on piezoelectric benders that display a non-linear behavior when driven with high frequency input commands and, if not compensated, show high unwanted ringing at particular resonance frequencies. If not corrected, this non-linear behavior precludes the application of high frequency deflections and the study of cortical responses to behaviorally relevant stimuli. To cope with the ringing problem, a mechanical and a software based solutions have been developed. With these corrections, the upper bound of the linear range of the bender is increased to 1 kHz. This new device allows the controlled delivery of large scale natural patterns of whisker deflections characterized by rapid high frequency vibrations of multiple whiskers.},

  abstract        = {The tactile sensations mediated by the whisker-trigeminal system allow rodents to efficiently detect and discriminate objects. These capabilities rely strongly on the temporal and spatial structure of whisker deflections. Subthreshold but also spiking receptive fields in the barrel cortex encompass a large number of vibrissae, and it seems likely that the functional properties of these multiwhisker receptive fields reflect the multiple-whisker interactions encountered by the animal during exploration of its environment. The aim of this study was to examine the dependence of the spatial structure of cortical receptive fields on stimulus parameters. Using a newly developed 24-whisker stimulation matrix, we applied a forward correlation analysis of spiking activity to randomized whisker deflections (sparse noise) to characterize the receptive fields that result from caudal and rostral directions of whisker deflection. We observed that the functionally determined principal whisker, the whisker eliciting the strongest response with the shortest latency, differed according to the direction of whisker deflection. Thus, for a given neuron, maximal responses to opposite directions of whisker deflections could be spatially separated. This spatial separation resulted in a displacement of the center of mass between the rostral and caudal subfields and was accompanied by differences between response latencies in rostral and caudal directions of whisker deflection. Such direction-dependent receptive field organization was observed in every cortical layer. We conclude that the spatial structure of receptive fields in the barrel cortex is not an intrinsic property of the neuron but depends on the properties of sensory input.},

Short-term memories are correlated with slow neural dynamics, including selective persistent activity, which can be maintained over seconds. In a delayed response task that requires short-term memory, neurons in the mouse anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) show persistent activity that instructs future actions. To determine the principles that underlie this persistent activity, here we combined intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology with optogenetic perturbations and network modelling. We show that during the delay epoch, the activity of ALM neurons moved towards discrete end points that correspond to specific movement directions. These end points were robust to transient shifts in ALM activity caused by optogenetic perturbations. Perturbations occasionally switched the population dynamics to the other end point, followed by incorrect actions. Our results show that discrete attractor dynamics underlie short-term memory related to motor planning.},

This preparatory activity has been observed across cortical layers, including in descending pyramidal tract neurons in layer 5. A key question is how preparatory activity is maintained without causing movement, and is ultimately converted to a motor command to trigger appropriate movements. Here, using single-cell transcriptional profiling and axonal reconstructions, we identify two types of pyramidal tract neuron. Both types project to several targets in the basal ganglia and brainstem. One type projects to thalamic regions that connect back to motor cortex; populations of these neurons produced early preparatory activity that persisted until the movement was initiated. The second type projects to motor centres in the medulla and mainly produced late preparatory activity and motor commands. These results indicate that two types of motor cortex output neurons have specialized roles in motor control.},

Nearly all types of GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)-containing neurons are shared across both areas, whereas most types of glutamatergic neurons were found in one of the two areas.

Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) can be delivered for this purpose using non-invasive genetic methods. Compared to viral gene transfer, transgenic targeting of GECIs provides stable long-term expression and obviates the need for invasive viral injections. Transgenic mice expressing the green GECI GCaMP6 are already widely used. Here we present the generation and characterization of transgenic mice expressing the sensitive red GECI jRGECO1a, driven by the Thy1 promoter. Four transgenic lines with different expression patterns showed sufficiently high expression for cellular in vivo imaging. We used two-photon microscopy to characterize visual responses of individual neurons in the visual cortex in vivo. The signal-to-noise ratio in transgenic mice was comparable to, or better than, mice transduced with adeno-associated virus. In addition, we show that Thy1-jRGECO1a transgenic mice are useful for transcranial population imaging and functional mapping using widefield fluorescence microscopy. We also demonstrate imaging of visual responses in retinal ganglion cells in vitro. Thy1-jRGECO1a transgenic mice are therefore a useful addition to the toolbox for imaging activity in intact neural networks.},

  abstract     = {The anterolateral motor cortex (ALM) and ventral medial (VM) thalamus are functionally linked to support persistent activity during motor planning. We analyzed the underlying synaptic interconnections using optogenetics and electrophysiology in mice (female/male). In cortex, thalamocortical (TC) axons from VM thalamus excited VM-projecting pyramidal tract (PT) neurons in layer 5B of ALM. These axons also strongly excited layer 2/3 neurons (which strongly excite PT neurons, as previously shown) but not VM-projecting corticothalamic (CT) neurons in layer 6. The strongest connections in the VM → PT circuit were localized to apical tuft dendrites of PT neurons, in layer 1. These tuft inputs were selectively augmented after blocking hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. In thalamus, axons from ALM PT neurons excited ALM-projecting VM neurons, located medially in VM. These axons provided weak input to neurons in mediodorsal nucleus, and little or no input either to neurons in the GABAergic reticular thalamic nucleus or to neurons in VM projecting to primary motor cortex (M1). Conversely, M1 PT axons excited M1- but not ALM-projecting VM neurons. Our findings indicate, first, a set of cell type-specific connections forming an excitatory thalamo-cortico-thalamic loop for ALM ↔ VM communication and a circuit-level substrate for supporting reverberant activity in this system. Second, a key feature of this loop is the prominent involvement of layer 1 synapses onto apical dendrites, a subcellular compartment with distinct signaling properties, including HCN-mediated gain control. Third, the segregation of the ALM ↔ VM loop from M1-related circuits of VM adds cellular-level support for the concept of parallel pathway organization in the motor system.  Anterolateral motor cortex (ALM), a higher-order motor area in the mouse, and ventromedial (VM) thalamus are anatomically and functionally linked, but their synaptic interconnections at the cellular level are unknown. Our results show that ALM pyramidal tract neurons monosynaptically excite ALM-projecting thalamocortical neurons in a medial subdivision of VM thalamus, and vice versa. The thalamo-cortico-thalamic loop formed by these recurrent connections constitutes a circuit-level substrate for supporting reverberant activity in this system.},

A key, long-standing question in neuroscience is to understand the neural correlates of such behavioral variability. To reveal these correlates, behavior and neural population activity must be related to one another on single trials. Such analysis is challenging due to the dynamical nature of brain function (e.g., in decision making), heterogeneity across neurons and limited sampling of the relevant neural population. By analyzing population recordings from mouse frontal cortex in perceptual decision-making tasks, we show that an analysis approach tailored to the coarse grain features of the dynamics is able to reveal previously unrecognized structure in the organization of population activity. This structure is similar on error and correct trials, suggesting dynamics that may be constrained by the underlying circuitry, is able to predict multiple aspects of behavioral variability and reveals long time-scale modulation of population activity.},

Preparatory activity is distributed across several brain regions , but it is unclear which brain areas are involved and how this activity is mediated by multi-regional interactions. The cerebellum is thought to be primarily involved in the short-timescale control of movement ; however, roles for this structure in cognitive processes have also been proposed . In humans, cerebellar damage can cause defects in planning and working memory . Here we show that persistent representation of information in the frontal cortex during motor planning is dependent on the cerebellum. Mice performed a sensory discrimination task in which they used short-term memory to plan a future directional movement. A transient perturbation in the medial deep cerebellar nucleus (fastigial nucleus) disrupted subsequent correct responses without hampering movement execution. Preparatory activity was observed in both the frontal cortex and the cerebellar nuclei, seconds before the onset of movement. The silencing of frontal cortex activity abolished preparatory activity in the cerebellar nuclei, and fastigial activity was necessary to maintain cortical preparatory activity. Fastigial output selectively targeted the behaviourally relevant part of the frontal cortex through the thalamus, thus closing a cortico-cerebellar loop. Our results support the view that persistent neural dynamics during motor planning is maintained by neural circuits that span multiple brain regions , and that cerebellar computations extend beyond online motor control .},

Therefore, the need arises to employ safe and efficient secondary P fertilizer sources, originating from P-rich wastes. These recycling sources are commonly tested in accordance with the current fertilizer rules, designed originally for conventional apatite-based P fertilizers. The behavior of sewage sludge ash, an inorganic recycling secondary P source, was investigated under soil-like conditions. Standardized soil P tests, including the soil buffering capacity test and the Olsen, the Mehlich3, and water extraction methods, were employed together with standardized fertilizer P-solubility tests by neutral ammonium citrate and 2% citric acid extraction. In addition, total content and the overall soil mobility of selected metallic elements present in sewage sludge ash were investigated. The suitability of standardized soil tests for the evaluation of recycling P sources was shown. An apparent influence of Ca:Al content ratio on sewage sludge ash behavior under different soil-like conditions shows the inadequacy of the current fertilizer test and the necessity to understand soil-like behavior of secondary P sources, when considering these as possible agricultural P bearers (fertilizers).},

  abstract     = {Neurons in multiple brain regions fire trains of action potentials anticipating specific movements, but this "preparatory activity" has not been systematically compared across behavioral tasks. We compared preparatory activity in auditory and tactile delayed-response tasks in male mice. Skilled, directional licking was the motor output. The anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) is necessary for motor planning in both tasks. Multiple features of ALM preparatory activity during the delay epoch were similar across tasks. First, most neurons showed direction-selective activity and spatially intermingled neurons were selective for either movement direction. Second, many cells showed mixed coding of sensory stimulus and licking direction, with a bias toward licking direction. Third, delay activity was monotonic and low-dimensional. Fourth, pairs of neurons with similar direction selectivity showed high spike-count correlations. Our study forms the foundation to analyze the neural circuit mechanisms underlying preparatory activity in a genetically tractable model organism.  Short-term memories link events separated in time. Neurons in the frontal cortex fire trains of action potentials anticipating specific movements, often seconds before the movement. This "preparatory activity" has been observed in multiple brain regions, but has rarely been compared systematically across behavioral tasks in the same brain region. To identify common features of preparatory activity, we developed and compared preparatory activity in auditory and tactile delayed-response tasks in mice. The same cortical area is necessary for both tasks. Multiple features of preparatory activity, measured with high-density silicon probes, were similar across tasks. We find that preparatory activity is low-dimensional and monotonic.

Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning.

  abstract        = {Vibrations are important cues for tactile perception across species. Whisker-based sensation in mice is a powerful model system for investigating mechanisms of tactile perception. However, the role vibration plays in whisker-based sensation remains unsettled, in part due to difficulties in modeling the vibration of whiskers. Here, we develop an analytical approach to calculate the vibrations of whiskers striking objects. We use this approach to quantify vibration forces during active whisker touch at a range of locations along the whisker. The frequency and amplitude of vibrations evoked by contact are strongly dependent on the position of contact along the whisker. The magnitude of vibrational shear force and bending moment is comparable to quasi-static forces. The fundamental vibration frequencies are in a detectable range for mechanoreceptor properties and below the maximum spike rates of primary sensory afferents. These results suggest two dynamic cues exist that rodents can use for object localization: vibration frequency and comparison of vibrational to quasi-static force magnitude. These complement the use of quasi-static force angle as a distance cue, particularly for touches close to the follicle, where whiskers are stiff and force angles hardly change during touch. Our approach also provides a general solution to calculation of whisker vibrations in other sensing tasks.},

  abstract        = {The world view of rodents is largely determined by sensation on two length scales. One is within the animal's peri-personal space; sensorimotor control on this scale involves active movements of the nose, tongue, head, and vibrissa, along with sniffing to determine olfactory clues. The second scale involves the detection of more distant space through vision and audition; these detection processes also impact repositioning of the head, eyes, and ears. Here we focus on orofacial motor actions, primarily vibrissa-based touch but including nose twitching, head bobbing, and licking, that control sensation at short, peri-personal distances. The orofacial nuclei for control of the motor plants, as well as primary and secondary sensory nuclei associated with these motor actions, lie within the hindbrain. The current data support three themes: First, the position of the sensors is determined by the summation of two drive signals, i.e., a fast rhythmic component and an evolving orienting component. Second, the rhythmic component is coordinated across all orofacial motor actions and is phase-locked to sniffing as the animal explores. Reverse engineering reveals that the preBötzinger inspiratory complex provides the reset to the relevant premotor oscillators. Third, direct feedback from somatosensory trigeminal nuclei can rapidly alter motion of the sensors. This feedback is disynaptic and can be tuned by high-level inputs. A holistic model for the coordination of orofacial motor actions into behaviors will encompass feedback pathways through the midbrain and forebrain, as well as hindbrain areas.},

Models of persistent activity often invoke reverberations within local cortical circuits, but long-range circuits could also contribute. Neurons in the mouse anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) have been shown to have selective persistent activity that instructs future actions. The ALM is connected bidirectionally with parts of the thalamus, including the ventral medial and ventral anterior-lateral nuclei. We recorded spikes from the ALM and thalamus during tactile discrimination with a delayed directional response. Here we show that, similar to ALM neurons, thalamic neurons exhibited selective persistent delay activity that predicted movement direction. Unilateral photoinhibition of delay activity in the ALM or thalamus produced contralesional neglect. Photoinhibition of the thalamus caused a short-latency and near-complete collapse of ALM activity. Similarly, photoinhibition of the ALM diminished thalamic activity. Our results show that the thalamus is a circuit hub in motor preparation and suggest that persistent activity requires reciprocal excitation across multiple brain areas.},

Using in vivo two-color two-photon imaging with genetically encoded calcium indicators, we demonstrate that individual ring neurons inherit simple-cell-like receptive fields from their upstream partners. Stimuli in the contralateral visual field suppressed responses to ipsilateral stimuli in both populations. Suppression strength depended on when and where the contralateral stimulus was presented, an effect stronger in ring neurons than in their upstream inputs. This history-dependent effect on the temporal structure of visual responses, which was well modeled by a simple biphasic filter, may determine how visual references are selected for the fly's internal compass. Our approach highlights how two-color calcium imaging can help identify and localize the origins of sensory transformations across synaptically connected neural populations.},

  abstract        = {During active somatosensation, neural signals expected from movement of the sensors are suppressed in the cortex, whereas information related to touch is enhanced. This tactile suppression underlies low-noise encoding of relevant tactile features and the brain's ability to make fine tactile discriminations. Layer (L) 4 excitatory neurons in the barrel cortex, the major target of the somatosensory thalamus (VPM), respond to touch, but have low spike rates and low sensitivity to the movement of whiskers. Most neurons in VPM respond to touch and also show an increase in spike rate with whisker movement. Therefore, signals related to self-movement are suppressed in L4. Fast-spiking (FS) interneurons in L4 show similar dynamics to VPM neurons. Stimulation of halorhodopsin in FS interneurons causes a reduction in FS neuron activity and an increase in L4 excitatory neuron activity. This decrease of activity of L4 FS neurons contradicts the "paradoxical effect" predicted in networks stabilized by inhibition and in strongly-coupled networks. To explain these observations, we constructed a model of the L4 circuit, with connectivity constrained by in vitro measurements. The model explores the various synaptic conductance strengths for which L4 FS neurons actively suppress baseline and movement-related activity in layer 4 excitatory neurons. Feedforward inhibition, in concert with recurrent intracortical circuitry, produces tactile suppression. Synaptic delays in feedforward inhibition allow transmission of temporally brief volleys of activity associated with touch. Our model provides a mechanistic explanation of a behavior-related computation implemented by the thalamocortical circuit.},

Here we imaged activity across motor cortex while mice performed a whisker-based object localization task with a delayed, directional licking response. During tactile sensation and the delay epoch, object location was represented in motor cortex areas that are medial and posterior relative to ALM, including vibrissal motor cortex. Preparatory activity appeared first in deep layers of ALM, seconds before the behavioral response, and remained localized to ALM until the behavioral response. Later, widely distributed neurons represented the outcome of the trial. Cortical area was more predictive of neuronal selectivity than laminar location or axonal projection target.

  abstract        = {Middle cerebral artery aneurysms (MCA aneurysms) belong to the most frequent type of intracranial aneurysms forming an intracerebral hematoma. The consequences of the hematoma-the laterality, the impact of ICH volume and size of the aneurysm with the final outcome of these patients had not been studied in detail in this location, and we focused on the analysis of these factors. Patients with MCA aneurysms and associated intracerebral hematomas with a volume ≥10 ml were studied; these were treated from January 2006 to December 2015. During this period, more than 700 patients with spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage were admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital Brno. The data were collected from the subarachnoid hemorrhage database of the unit and from the local hospital registry. All consecutive patients at the treating center were involved in this retrospective study. We collected clinical data such as age, gender, aneurysm location, preoperative hematoma size, Hunt-Hess grade and type of surgical procedures. We focused on the analysis of the final outcome [Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score] in relation to ICH volume, side of bleeding and finally the relationship between aneurysm size and the volume of ICH. Fifty-eight patients with an MCA aneurysm and ICH were included; the mean age of this series was 59.4 years. Thirty-six patients (62%) had clinical status Hunt-Hess 4-5 on admission. The mean size of the intracerebral hematoma was 47.1 ml (10-133 ml). Most frequently, in 30 patients (52%), the hematoma had bled into the temporal lobe. Fifty three patients were operated on, and 5 were treated conservatively because of their poor condition. Twenty-three patients (40%) had a favorable Glasgow Outcome Scale score, and 35 (60%) had an unfavorable outcome including 20 patients (35%) who died. Of the 53 patients operated on, 20 (38%) underwent decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC). Patients with an unfavorable outcome had significantly larger hematomas with a median size of 54 ml, whereas those with a favorable outcome had a median size of 26 ml (p = 0.0022). Larger hematomas were found on the right side. The cutoff volume for an unfavorable outcome in ICH was 25 ml. The outcomes were not related to the side of the ICH (p = 0.42), and the aneurysm size did not predetermine the ICH volume (p = 0.3159). Our study confirms the benefit of the active treatment of patients with MCA aneurysms and associated ICH. A significant proportion of these patients achieves a favorable outcome. No association between the side of bleeding and outcome was demonstrated. Hematomas larger than 25 ml have a greater tendency to lead to an unfavorable outcome. The treatment decision-making process should not differ for either side.},

  abstract        = {We rely on movement to explore the environment, for example, by palpating an object. In somatosensory cortex, activity related to movement of digits or whiskers is suppressed, which could facilitate detection of touch. Movement-related suppression is generally assumed to involve corollary discharges. Here we uncovered a thalamocortical mechanism in which cortical fast-spiking interneurons, driven by sensory input, suppress movement-related activity in layer 4 (L4) excitatory neurons. In mice locating objects with their whiskers, neurons in the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) fired in response to touch and whisker movement. Cortical L4 fast-spiking interneurons inherited these responses from VPM. In contrast, L4 excitatory neurons responded mainly to touch. Optogenetic experiments revealed that fast-spiking interneurons reduced movement-related spiking in excitatory neurons, enhancing selectivity for touch-related information during active tactile sensation. These observations suggest a fundamental computation performed by the thalamocortical circuit to accentuate salient tactile information.},

Network models can produce persistent and ramping activity, but the positive feedback that is critical for these slow dynamics can cause sensitivity to perturbations. Here we use electrophysiology and optogenetic perturbations in the mouse premotor cortex to probe the robustness of persistent neural representations during motor planning. We show that preparatory activity is remarkably robust to large-scale unilateral silencing: detailed neural dynamics that drive specific future movements were quickly and selectively restored by the network. Selectivity did not recover after bilateral silencing of the premotor cortex. Perturbations to one hemisphere are thus corrected by information from the other hemisphere. Corpus callosum bisections demonstrated that premotor cortex hemispheres can maintain preparatory activity independently. Redundancy across selectively coupled modules, as we observed in the premotor cortex, is a hallmark of robust control systems. Network models incorporating these principles show robustness that is consistent with data.},

However, current red GECIs are inferior to the state-of-the-art GFP-based GCaMP6 indicators for detecting and quantifying neural activity. Here we present improved red GECIs based on mRuby (jRCaMP1a, b) and mApple (jRGECO1a), with sensitivity comparable to GCaMP6. We characterized the performance of the new red GECIs in cultured neurons and in mouse, Drosophila, zebrafish and C. elegans in vivo. Red GECIs facilitate deep-tissue imaging, dual-color imaging together with GFP-based reporters, and the use of optogenetics in combination with calcium imaging.},

We introduce a platform for high-resolution, three-dimensional fluorescence imaging of complete tissue volumes that enables the visualization and reconstruction of long-range axonal arbors. This platform relies on a high-speed two-photon microscope integrated with a tissue vibratome and a suite of computational tools for large-scale image data. We demonstrate the power of this approach by reconstructing the axonal arbors of multiple neurons in the motor cortex across a single mouse brain.},

Optogenetic manipulations revealed that barrel cortex plays a role in wall-tracking. Closed-loop optogenetic control of layer 4 neurons can substitute for whisker-object contact to guide behavior resembling wall tracking. We measured neural activity using two-photon calcium imaging and extracellular recordings. Neurons were tuned to the distance between the animal snout and the contralateral wall, with monotonic, unimodal, and multimodal tuning curves. This rich representation of object location in the barrel cortex could not be predicted based on simple stimulus-response relationships involving individual whiskers and likely emerges within cortical circuits.},

  abstract        = {Dry methods of the flue gas cleaning (for HCl and SO2 removal) are useful particularly in smaller solid waste incineration units. The amount and forms of mercury emissions depend on waste (fuel) composition, content of mercury and chlorine and on the entire process of the flue gas cleaning. In the case of high HCl/total Hg molar ratio in the flue gas, the majority (usually 70-90%) of mercury is present in the form of HgCl2 and a smaller amount in the form of mercury vapors at higher temperatures. Removal of both main forms of mercury from the flue gas is dependent on chemical reactions and sorption processes at the temperatures below approx. 340 °C. Significant part of HgCl2 and a small part of elemental Hg vapors can be adsorbed on fly ash and solid particle in the air pollution control (APC) processes, which are removed in dust filters. Injection of non-impregnated active carbon (AC) or activated lignite coke particles is able to remove mainly the oxidized Hg(2+) compounds. Vapors of metallic Hg(o) are adsorbed relatively weakly. Much better chemisorption of Hg(o) together with higher sorbent capacity is achieved by AC-based sorbents impregnated with sulfur, alkali poly-sulfides, ferric chloride, etc. Inorganic sorbents with the same or similar chemical impregnation are also applicable for deeper Hg(o) removal (over 85%). SCR catalysts convert part of Hg(o) into oxidized compounds (HgO, HgCl2, etc.) contributing to more efficient Hg removal, but excess of NH3 has a negative effect. Both forms, elemental Hg(o) and HgCl2, can be converted into HgS particles by reacting with droplets/aerosol of poly-sulfides solutions/solids in flue gas. Mercury captured in the form of water insoluble HgS is more advantageous in the disposal of solid waste from APC processes. Four selected options of the dry flue gas cleaning with mercury removal are analyzed, assessed and compared (in terms of efficiency of Hg-emission reduction and costs) with wet methods and retrofits for more efficient Hg-removal. Overall mercury removal efficiencies from flue gas can attain 80-95%, depending on sorbent type/impregnation, sorbent surplus and operating conditions.},

  abstract        = {Cortical spike trains often appear noisy, with the timing and number of spikes varying across repetitions of stimuli. Spiking variability can arise from internal (behavioral state, unreliable neurons, or chaotic dynamics in neural circuits) and external (uncontrolled behavior or sensory stimuli) sources. The amount of irreducible internal noise in spike trains, an important constraint on models of cortical networks, has been difficult to estimate, since behavior and brain state must be precisely controlled or tracked. We recorded from excitatory barrel cortex neurons in layer 4 during active behavior, where mice control tactile input through learned whisker movements. Touch was the dominant sensorimotor feature, with &gt;70% spikes occurring in millisecond timescale epochs after touch onset. The variance of touch responses was smaller than expected from Poisson processes, often reaching the theoretical minimum. Layer 4 spike trains thus reflect the millisecond-timescale structure of tactile input with little noise.},

We dissected the conversion of preparatory activity to movement within a structured motor cortex circuit. An anterior lateral region of the mouse cortex (a possible homologue of premotor cortex in primates) contains equal proportions of intermingled neurons predicting ipsi- or contralateral movements, yet unilateral inactivation of this cortical region during movement planning disrupts contralateral movements. Using cell-type-specific electrophysiology, cellular imaging and optogenetic perturbation, we show that layer 5 neurons projecting within the cortex have unbiased laterality. Activity with a contralateral population bias arises specifically in layer 5 neurons projecting to the brainstem, and only late during movement planning. These results reveal the transformation of distributed preparatory activity into movement commands within hierarchically organized cortical circuits.},

We used volumetric two-photon imaging in mice expressing GCaMP6s and nuclear red fluorescent proteins to sample activity in 75% of superficial barrel cortex neurons across the relevant cortical columns, approximately 12,000 neurons per animal, during performance of a single whisker object localization task. Task-related activity peaked during object palpation. An encoding model related activity to behavioral variables. In the column corresponding to the spared whisker, 300 layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons (17%) each encoded touch and whisker movements. Touch representation declined by half in surrounding columns; whisker movement representation was unchanged. Following the emergence of stereotyped task-related movement, sensory representations showed no measurable plasticity. Touch direction was topographically organized, with distinct organization for passive and active touch. Our work reveals sparse and spatially intermingled representations of multiple tactile features. VIDEO ABSTRACT.},

Differences in input might account for diverse responses in neighboring neurons during behavior. We present a strategy for comparing the strengths of multiple types of input onto the same neuron. We developed methods for independent dual-channel photostimulation of synaptic inputs using ChR2 together with ReaChR, a red-shifted channelrhodopsin. We used dual-channel photostimulation to probe convergence of sensory information in the mouse primary motor cortex. Input from somatosensory cortex and thalamus converges in individual neurons. Similarly, inputs from distinct somatotopic regions of the somatosensory cortex are integrated at the level of single motor cortex neurons. We next developed a ReaChR transgenic mouse under the control of both Flp- and Cre-recombinases that is an effective tool for circuit mapping. Our approach to dual-channel photostimulation enables quantitative comparison of the strengths of multiple pathways across all length scales of the brain.},

The brain has remarkable abilities to focus its limited resources on information that matters, while ignoring a cacophony of distractions. While inspecting a visual scene, primates foveate to multiple salient locations, for example mouths and eyes in images of people, and ignore the rest. Similar processes have now been observed and studied in rodents in the context of whisker-based tactile sensation. Rodents use their mechanosensitive whiskers for a diverse range of tactile behaviors such as navigation, object recognition and social interactions. These animals move their whiskers in a purposive manner to locations of interest. The shapes of whiskers, as well as their movements, are exquisitely adapted for tactile exploration in the dark tight burrows where many rodents live. By studying whisker movements during tactile behaviors, we can learn about the tactile information available to rodents through their whiskers and how rodents direct their attention. In this primer, we focus on how the whisker movements of rats and mice are providing clues about the logic of active sensation and the underlying neural mechanisms.},

Furthermore, the high dimensionality of the space of possible stimuli and movements compounds the problem of experimental control. Head fixation facilitates stimulus control and movement tracking, and can be combined with techniques for recording and manipulating neural activity. However, head-fixed mouse behaviors are typically trained through extensive instrumental conditioning. Here we present a whisker-based, tactile virtual reality system for head-fixed mice running on a spherical treadmill. Head-fixed mice displayed natural movements, including running and rhythmic whisking at 16 Hz. Whisking was centered on a set point that changed in concert with running so that more protracted whisking was correlated with faster running. During turning, whiskers moved in an asymmetric manner, with more retracted whisker positions in the turn direction and protracted whisker movements on the other side. Under some conditions, whisker movements were phase-coupled to strides. We simulated a virtual reality tactile corridor, consisting of two moveable walls controlled in a closed-loop by running speed and direction. Mice used their whiskers to track the walls of the winding corridor without training. Whisker curvature changes, which cause forces in the sensory follicles at the base of the whiskers, were tightly coupled to distance from the walls. Our behavioral system allows for precise control of sensorimotor variables during natural tactile navigation.},

Touch through facial whiskers is important during these activities, but the close quarters makes whisker deployment challenging. The diverse shapes of facial whiskers reflect distinct ecological niches. Rodent whiskers are conical, often with a remarkably linear taper. Here we use theoretical and experimental methods to analyze interactions of mouse whiskers with objects. When pushed into objects, conical whiskers suddenly slip at a critical angle. In contrast, cylindrical whiskers do not slip for biologically plausible movements. Conical whiskers sweep across objects and textures in characteristic sequences of brief sticks and slips, which provide information about the tactile world. In contrast, cylindrical whiskers stick and remain stuck, even when sweeping across fine textures. Thus the conical whisker structure is adaptive for sensor mobility in constrained environments and in feature extraction during active haptic exploration of objects and surfaces.

  abstract        = {The mouse is an increasingly prominent model for the analysis of mammalian neuronal circuits. Neural circuits ultimately have to be probed during behaviors that engage the circuits. Linking circuit dynamics to behavior requires precise control of sensory stimuli and measurement of body movements. Head-fixation has been used for behavioral research, particularly in non-human primates, to facilitate precise stimulus control, behavioral monitoring and neural recording. However, choice-based, perceptual decision tasks by head-fixed mice have only recently been introduced. Training mice relies on motivating mice using water restriction. Here we describe procedures for head-fixation, water restriction and behavioral training for head-fixed mice, with a focus on active, whisker-based tactile behaviors. In these experiments mice had restricted access to water (typically 1 ml/day). After ten days of water restriction, body weight stabilized at approximately 80% of initial weight. At that point mice were trained to discriminate sensory stimuli using operant conditioning. Head-fixed mice reported stimuli by licking in go/no-go tasks and also using a forced choice paradigm using a dual lickport. In some cases mice learned to discriminate sensory stimuli in a few trials within the first behavioral session. Delay epochs lasting a second or more were used to separate sensation (e.g. tactile exploration) and action (i.e. licking). Mice performed a variety of perceptual decision tasks with high performance for hundreds of trials per behavioral session. Up to four months of continuous water restriction showed no adverse health effects. Behavioral performance correlated with the degree of water restriction, supporting the importance of controlling access to water. These behavioral paradigms can be combined with cellular resolution imaging, random access photostimulation, and whole cell recordings.},

Here we delineate when and how activity in specific areas drives a whisker-based decision in mice. A short-term memory component temporally separated tactile "sensation" and "action" (licking). Using optogenetic inhibition (spatial resolution, 2 mm; temporal resolution, 100 ms), we surveyed the neocortex for regions driving behavior during specific behavioral epochs. Barrel cortex was critical for sensation. During the short-term memory, unilateral inhibition of anterior lateral motor cortex biased responses to the ipsilateral side. Consistently, barrel cortex showed stimulus-specific activity during sensation, whereas motor cortex showed choice-specific preparatory activity and movement-related activity, consistent with roles in motor planning and movement. These results suggest serial information flow from sensory to motor areas during perceptual decision making.},

Despite this, there is little quantitative data on spatial distributions of specific types of synaptic input. Here we use array tomography (AT), a high-resolution optical microscopy method, to examine thalamocortical (TC) input onto layer 5 pyramidal neurons. We first verified the ability of AT to identify synapses using parallel electron microscopic analysis of TC synapses in layer 4. We then use large-scale array tomography (LSAT) to measure TC synapse distribution on L5 pyramidal neurons in a 1.00 × 0.83 × 0.21 mm(3) volume of mouse somatosensory cortex. We found that TC synapses primarily target basal dendrites in layer 5, but also make a considerable input to proximal apical dendrites in L4, consistent with previous work. Our analysis further suggests that TC inputs are biased toward certain branches and, within branches, synapses show significant clustering with an excess of TC synapse nearest neighbors within 5-15 μm compared to a random distribution. Thus, we show that AT is a sensitive and quantitative method to map specific types of synaptic input on the dendrites of entire neurons. We anticipate that this technique will be of wide utility for mapping functionally-relevant anatomical connectivity in neural circuits.},

In layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the mouse visual cortex, GCaMP6 reliably detected single action potentials in neuronal somata and orientation-tuned synaptic calcium transients in individual dendritic spines. The orientation tuning of structurally persistent spines was largely stable over timescales of weeks. Orientation tuning averaged across spine populations predicted the tuning of their parent cell. Although the somata of GABAergic neurons showed little orientation tuning, their dendrites included highly tuned dendritic segments (5-40-µm long). GCaMP6 sensors thus provide new windows into the organization and dynamics of neural circuits over multiple spatial and temporal scales.},

We photostimulated layer 4 activity in single barrels in a closed loop with whisking. Mimicking touch-related neural activity caused illusory perception of an object at a particular location, but scrambling the timing of the spikes over one whisking cycle (tens of milliseconds) did not abolish the illusion, indicating that knowledge of instantaneous whisker position is unnecessary for discriminating object locations. The illusions were induced only during bouts of directed whisking, when mice expected touch, and in the relevant barrel. Reducing activity biased behavior, consistent with a spike count code for object detection at a particular location. Our results show that mice integrate coding of touch with movement over timescales of a whisking bout to produce perception of active touch.},

However, the dynamics of neuronal state variables (e.g., voltage, calcium, etc.) are typically very rapid compared to those of non-excitable cells. We developed an electrical stimulation and fluorescence imaging platform based on dissociated rat primary neuronal cultures. We describe its use in testing genetically-encoded calcium indicators (GECIs). Efficient neuronal GECI expression was achieved using lentiviruses containing a neuronal-selective gene promoter. Action potentials (APs) and thus neuronal calcium levels were quantitatively controlled by electrical field stimulation, and fluorescence images were recorded. Images were segmented to extract fluorescence signals corresponding to individual GECI-expressing neurons, which improved sensitivity over full-field measurements. We demonstrate the superiority of screening GECIs in neurons compared with solution measurements. Neuronal screening was useful for efficient identification of variants with both improved response kinetics and high signal amplitudes. This platform can be used to screen many types of sensors with cellular resolution under realistic conditions where neuronal state variables are in relevant ranges with respect to timing and amplitude.},

Whiskers interact with objects, causing stresses in whisker follicles and spikes in sensory neurons, which are interpreted by the brain to produce tactile perception. The mechanics of the whisker thus couple self-movement and the structure of the world to sensation. Whiskers are elastic thin rods; hence, they tend to vibrate. Whisker vibrations could be a key ingredient of rodent somatosensation. However, the specific conditions under which vibrations contribute appreciably to the stresses in the follicle remain unclear. We present an analytical solution for the deformation of individual whiskers in response to a time-varying force. We tracked the deformation of mouse whiskers during a pole localization task to extract the whisker Young's modulus and damping coefficient. We further extracted the time course and amplitude of steady-state forces during whisker-object contact. We use our model to calculate the relative contribution of steady-state and vibrational forces to stresses in the follicle in a variety of active sensation tasks and during the passive whisker stimuli typically used for sensory physiology. Vibrational stresses are relatively more prominent compared with steady-state forces for short contacts and for contacts close to the whisker tip. Vibrational stresses are large for texture discrimination, and under some conditions, object localization tasks. Vibrational stresses are negligible for typical ramp-and-hold stimuli. Our calculation provides a general framework, applicable to most experimental situations.},

Less attention has been paid to small vessel disease which gives rise to covert stroke that often leads to vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). One reason for this may be the relative lack of relevant animal models. Herein, we describe, a model of VCI induced in middle-aged Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to a diet high in saturated fats, salt and refined sugar (HFSS). In Experiment 1, rats were fed HFSS and subjected to a small mediodorsal (MD) thalamic stroke with or without concomitant permanent bilateral carotid artery occlusion. MD lesions produce significant executive dysfunction in an attention set-shift task ( p = 0.012). In Experiment 2, rats were exposed to either HFSS or control diet and functional effects assessed. We found significant hypertension ( p = 0.013), blockage of brain microvessels ( p = 0.018) and white matter atrophy ( p = 0.039) in HFSS diet animals. As in Experiment 1, profound, specific set-shifting executive dysfunction was noted ( p = 0.003) following both small MD infarcts (0.332 mm ) and the HFSS diet. In summary, these data describe a middle-aged animal model of VCI that includes clinically relevant metabolic disturbances and small vessel disease and as such may be helpful in developing new cognitive therapies.},

  abstract     = {Skilled forelimb function in mice is traditionally studied through behavioral paradigms that require extensive training by investigators and are limited by the number of trials individual animals are able to perform within a supervised session. We developed a skilled lever positioning task that mice can perform within their home cage. The task requires mice to use their forelimb to precisely hold a lever mounted on a rotary encoder within a rewarded position to dispense a water reward. A Raspberry Pi microcomputer is used to record lever position during trials and to control task parameters, thus making this low-footprint apparatus ideal for use within animal housing facilities. Custom Python software automatically increments task difficulty by requiring a longer hold duration, or a more accurate hold position, to dispense a reward. The performance of individual animals within group-housed mice is tracked through radio-frequency identification implants, and data stored on the microcomputer may be accessed remotely through an active internet connection. Mice continuously engage in the task for over 2.5 mo and perform ~500 trials/24 h. Mice required ~15,000 trials to learn to hold the lever within a 10° range for 1.5 s and were able to further refine movement accuracy by limiting their error to a 5° range within each trial. These results demonstrate the feasibility of autonomously training group-housed mice on a forelimb motor task. This paradigm may be used in the future to assess functional recovery after injury or cortical reorganization induced by self-directed motor learning. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We developed a low-cost system for fully autonomous training of group-housed mice on a forelimb motor task. We demonstrate the feasibility of tracking both end-point, as well as kinematic performance of individual mice, with each performing thousands of trials over 2.5 mo. The task is run and controlled by a Raspberry Pi microcomputer, which allows for cages to be monitored remotely through an active internet connection.},

  abstract     = {Small vessel disease is characterized by sporadic obstruction of small vessels leading to neuronal cell death. These microinfarcts often escape detection by conventional magnetic resonance imaging and are identified only upon postmortem examination. Our work explores a brain-wide microinfarct model in awake head-fixed mice, where occlusions of small penetrating arterioles are reproduced by endovascular injection of fluorescent microspheres. Mesoscopic functional connectivity was mapped longitudinally in awake GCaMP6 mice using genetically encoded calcium indicators for transcranial wide-field calcium imaging. Microsphere occlusions were quantified and changes in cerebral blood flow were measured with laser speckle imaging. The neurodeficit score in microinfarct mice was significantly higher than in sham, indicating impairment in motor function. The novel object recognition test showed a reduction in the discrimination index in microinfarct mice compared to sham. Graph-theoretic analysis of functional connectivity did not reveal significant differences in functional connectivity between sham and microinfarct mice. While behavioral tasks revealed impairments following microinfarct induction, the absence of measurable functional alterations in cortical activity has a less straightforward interpretation. The behavioral alterations produced by this model are consistent with alterations observed in human patients suffering from microinfarcts and support the validity of microsphere injection as a microinfarct model.},

  abstract        = {Rodent models of neurological disease such as stroke are often characterized by motor deficits. One of the tests that are used to assess these motor deficits is the tapered beam test, which provides a sensitive measure of bilateral motor function based on foot faults (slips) made by a rodent traversing a gradually narrowing beam. However, manual frame-by-frame scoring of video recordings is necessary to obtain test results, which is time-consuming and prone to human rater bias. We present a cost-effective method for automated touch sensing in the tapered beam test. Capacitive touch sensors detect foot faults onto the beam through a layer of conductive paint, and results are processed and stored on a Raspberry Pi computer. Automated touch sensing using this method achieved high sensitivity (96.2%) as compared to 'gold standard' manual video scoring. Furthermore, it provided a reliable measure of lateralized motor deficits in mice with unilateral photothrombotic stroke: results indicated an increased number of contralesional foot faults for up to 6days after ischemia. The automated adaptation of the tapered beam test produces results immediately after each trial, without the need for labor-intensive post-hoc video scoring. It also increases objectivity of the data as it requires less experimenter involvement during analysis. Automated touch sensing may provide a useful adaptation to the existing tapered beam test in mice, while the simplicity of the hardware lends itself to potential further adaptations to related behavioral tests.},

However, the indirect nature of human in vivo glutamate and activity assessments obscures mechanistic details. Using the chronic social defeat mouse model of depression, we determine how mesoscale glutamatergic networks are altered after chronic stress, and in response to the rapid acting antidepressant, ketamine. Transgenic mice (Ai85) expressing iGluSnFR (a recombinant protein sensor) permitted real-time in vivo selective characterization of extracellular glutamate and longitudinal imaging of mesoscale cortical glutamatergic functional circuits. Mice underwent chronic social defeat or a control condition, while spontaneous cortical activity was longitudinally sampled. After chronic social defeat, we observed network-wide glutamate functional hyperconnectivity in defeated animals, which was confirmed with voltage sensitive dye imaging in an independent cohort. Subanaesthetic ketamine has unique effects in defeated animals. Acutely, subanaesthetic ketamine induces large global cortical glutamate transients in defeated animals, and an elevated subanaesthetic dose resulted in sustained global increase in cortical glutamate. Local cortical inhibition of glutamate transporters in naïve mice given ketamine produced a similar extracellular glutamate phenotype, with both glutamate transients and a dose-dependent accumulation of glutamate. Twenty-four hours after ketamine, normalization of depressive-like behaviour in defeated animals was accompanied by reduced glutamate functional connectivity strength. Altered glutamate functional connectivity in this animal model confirms the central role of glutamate dynamics as well as network-wide changes after chronic stress and in response to ketamine.},

  abstract        = {Connectivity mapping based on resting-state activity in mice has revealed functional motifs of correlated activity. However, the rules by which motifs organize into larger functional modules that lead to hemisphere wide spatial-temporal activity sequences is not clear. We explore cortical activity parcellation in head-fixed, quiet awake GCaMP6 mice from both sexes by using mesoscopic calcium imaging. Spectral decomposition of spontaneous cortical activity revealed the presence of two dominant frequency modes (<1 and ∼3 Hz), each of them associated with a unique spatial signature of cortical macro-parcellation not predicted by classical cytoarchitectonic definitions of cortical areas. Based on assessment of 0.1-1 Hz activity, we define two macro-organizing principles: the first being a rotating polymodal-association pinwheel structure around which activity flows sequentially from visual to barrel then to hindlimb somatosensory; the second principle is correlated activity symmetry planes that exist on many levels within a single domain such as intrahemispheric reflections of sensory and motor cortices. In contrast, higher frequency activity >1 Hz yielded two larger clusters of coactivated areas with an enlarged default mode network-like posterior region. We suggest that the apparent constrained structure for intra-areal cortical activity flow could be exploited in future efforts to normalize activity in diseases of the nervous system.  Increasingly, functional connectivity mapping of spontaneous activity is being used to reveal the organization of the brain. However, because the brain operates across multiple space and time domains a more detailed understanding of this organization is necessary. We used   wide-field calcium imaging of the indicator GCaMP6 in head-fixed, awake mice to characterize the organization of spontaneous cortical activity at different spatiotemporal scales. Correlation analysis defines the presence of two to three superclusters of activity that span traditionally defined functional territories and were frequency dependent. This work helps define the rules for how different cortical areas interact in time and space. We provide a framework necessary for future studies that explore functional reorganization of brain circuits in disease models.},

In other applications periodic weighing is necessary to assess drug side-effects, or as an endpoint in feeding experiments. Periodic weighing while essential can disrupt animal circadian rhythms and social structure. Automatic weighing system within paired mouse homecages. Up to 10 mice freely move between two cages (28×18×9cm) which were connected by a weighing chamber mounted on a load cell. Each mouse was identified using an RFID tag placed under the skin of the neck. A single-board computer (Raspberry Pi; RPi) controls the task, logging RFID tag, load cell weights, and time stamps from each RFID detection until the animal leaves the chamber. Collected data were statistically analyzed to estimate mouse weights. We anticipate integration with tasks where automated imaging or behaviour is assessed in homecages. Mice frequently move between the two cages, an average of 42+-16 times/day/mouse at which time we obtained weights. We report accurate determination of mouse weight and long term monitoring over 53days. Comparison with existing methods Although commercial systems are available for automatically weighing rodents, they only work with single animals, or are not open source nor cost effective for specific custom application. This automated system permits automated weighing of mice ∼40 times per day. The system employs inexpensive hardware and open-source Python code.},

  abstract        = {Behavioral testing is a critical step in assessing the validity of rodent models of neurodegenerative disease, as well as evaluating the efficacy of pharmacological interventions. In models of Huntington's disease (HD), a gradual progression of impairments is observed across ages, increasing the need for sensitive, high-throughput and longitudinal assessments. Recently, a number of automated systems have been developed to perform behavioral profiling of animals within their own home-cage, allowing for 24-h monitoring and minimizing experimenter interaction. However, as of yet, few of these have had functionality for the assessment of skilled motor learning, a relevant behavior for movement disorders such as HD. To address this, we assess a lever positioning task within the mouse home-cage. Animals first acquire a simple operant response, before moving to a second phase where they must learn to hold the lever for progressively longer in a rewarded position range. Testing with this paradigm has revealed the presence of distinct phenotypes in the YAC128 mouse model of HD at three early symptomatic time points. YAC128 mice at two months old, but not older, had a motor learning deficit when required to adapt their response to changes in task requirements. In contrast, six-month-old YAC128 mice had disruptions of normal circadian activity and displayed kinematic abnormalities during performance of the task, suggesting an impairment in motor control. This system holds promise for facilitating high throughput behavioral assessment of HD mouse models for preclinical therapeutic screening.},

Furthermore, imaging of blood flow during stroke is not routinely done.

Our protocol does not require any surgical steps at the time of stroke induction or anesthetics during either head fixation or photoactivation. In addition, we performed laser speckle contrast imaging and wide-field calcium imaging to reveal the effect of cortical spreading ischemic depolarization after stroke in both anesthetized and awake animals over a spatial scale encompassing both hemispheres. With our combined approach, we observed ischemic depolarizing waves (3 to [Formula: see text]) propagating across the cortex 1 to 5 min after stroke induction in genetically encoded calcium indicator mice. Measures of blood flow by laser speckle were correlated with neurological impairment and lesion volume, suggesting a metric for reducing experimental variability. The ability to follow brain dynamics immediately after stroke as well as during recovery may provide a valuable guide to develop activity-dependent therapeutic interventions to be performed shortly after stroke induction.},

In vivo, wide-field GCaMP imaging and sub-cortical/cortical cellular electrophysiology were used in mice to investigate relationships between spontaneous single neuron spiking and mesoscopic cortical activity. We make use of a rich set of cortical activity motifs that are present in spontaneous activity in anesthetized and awake animals. A mesoscale spike-triggered averaging procedure allowed the identification of motifs that are preferentially linked to individual spiking neurons by employing genetically targeted indicators of neuronal activity. Thalamic neurons predicted and reported specific cycles of wide-scale cortical inhibition/excitation. In contrast, spike-triggered maps derived from single cortical neurons yielded spatio-temporal maps expected for regional cortical consensus function. This approach can define network relationships between any point source of neuronal spiking and mesoscale cortical maps.},

Ideally, an application should be user friendly with a graphical user interface, able to read data files in a variety of formats, and provide users with a flexible set of tools giving them the ability to detect and sort extracellular voltage waveforms from different units with some degree of reliability. Previously published spike sorting methods are now available in a software program, SpikeSorter, intended to provide electrophysiologists with a complete set of tools for sorting, starting from raw recorded data file and ending with the export of sorted spikes times. Procedures are automated to the extent this is currently possible. The article explains and illustrates the use of the program. A representative data file is opened, extracellular traces are filtered, events are detected and then clustered. A number of problems that commonly occur during sorting are illustrated, including the artefactual over-splitting of units due to the tendency of some units to fire spikes in pairs where the second spike is significantly smaller than the first, and over-splitting caused by slow variation in spike height over time encountered in some units. The accuracy of SpikeSorter's performance has been tested with surrogate ground truth data and found to be comparable to that of other algorithms in current development.},

RFID tags were injected sub-cutaneously after brief isoflurane anesthesia and do not require surgical steps such as suturing or incisions. We employ glass-encapsulated 125kHz tags that can be read within 30.2±2.4mm of the antenna. A raspberry pi single board computer and tag reader enable automated logging and cross platform support is possible through Python. We provide sample software written in Python to provide a flexible and cost effective system for logging the weights of multiple mice in relation to pre-defined targets. The sample software can serve as the basis of any behavioral or physiological task where users will need to identify and track specific animals. Recently, we have applied this system of tagging to automated mouse brain imaging within home-cages. We provide a cost effective solution employing open source software to facilitate adoption in applications such as automated imaging or tracking individual animal weights during tasks where food or water restriction is employed as motivation for a specific behavior.},

Autism-associated mutations in MDGA2 (MAM domain containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor 2) are thought to reduce excitatory/inhibitory transmission. However, we show that mutation of Mdga2 elevates excitatory transmission, and that MDGA2 blocks neuroligin-1 interaction with neurexins and suppresses excitatory synapse development. Mdga2(+/-) mice, modeling autism mutations, demonstrated increased asymmetric synapse density, mEPSC frequency and amplitude, and altered LTP, with no change in measures of inhibitory synapses. Behavioral assays revealed an autism-like phenotype including stereotypy, aberrant social interactions, and impaired memory. In vivo voltage-sensitive dye imaging, facilitating comparison with fMRI studies in autism, revealed widespread increases in cortical spontaneous activity and intracortical functional connectivity. These results suggest that mutations in MDGA2 contribute to altered cortical processing through the dual disadvantages of elevated excitation and hyperconnectivity, and indicate that perturbations of the NRXN-NLGN pathway in either direction from the norm increase risk for autism.},

  abstract        = {Cortical sensory systems are active with rich patterns of activity during sleep and under light anesthesia. Remarkably, this activity shares many characteristics with those present when the awake brain responds to sensory stimuli. We review two specific forms of such activity: slow-wave activity (SWA) in the adult brain and spindle bursts in developing brain. SWA is composed of 0.5-4 Hz resting potential fluctuations. Although these fluctuations synchronize wide regions of cortex, recent large-scale imaging has shown spatial details of their distribution that reflect underlying cortical structural projections and networks. These networks are regulated, as prior awake experiences alter both the spatial and temporal features of SWA in subsequent sleep. Activity patterns of the immature brain, however, are very different from those of the adult. SWA is absent, and the dominant pattern is spindle bursts, intermittent high frequency oscillations superimposed on slower depolarizations within sensory cortices. These bursts are driven by intrinsic brain activity, which act to generate peripheral inputs, for example via limb twitches. They are present within developing sensory cortex before they are mature enough to exhibit directed movements and respond to external stimuli. Like in the adult, these patterns resemble those evoked by sensory stimulation when awake. It is suggested that spindle-burst activity is generated purposefully by the developing nervous system as a proxy for true external stimuli. While the sleep-related functions of both slow-wave and spindle-burst activity may not be entirely clear, they reflect robust regulated phenomena which can engage select wide-spread cortical circuits. These circuits are similar to those activated during sensory processing and volitional events. We highlight these two patterns of brain activity because both are prominent and well-studied forms of spontaneous activity that will yield valuable insights into brain function in the coming years.},

We describe a reproducible and simple procedure for chronic through-bone wide-field imaging in awake head-fixed mice providing stable optical access for chronic imaging over large areas of the cortex for months. The preparation is produced by applying clear-drying dental cement to the intact mouse skull, followed by a glass coverslip to create a partially transparent imaging surface. Surgery time takes about 30min. A single set-screw provides a stable means of attachment (in relation to the measured lateral and axial resolution) for mesoscale assessment without obscuring the cortical field of view. We demonstrate the utility of this method by showing seed-pixel functional connectivity maps generated from spontaneous cortical activity of GCAMP6 signals in both awake and anesthetized mice in longitudinal studies of up to 2 months in duration. We propose that the intact skull preparation described here may be used for most longitudinal studies that do not require micron scale resolution and where cortical neural or vascular signals are recorded with intrinsic sensors or in transgenic mice expressing genetically encoded sensors of activity.},

  abstract        = {Motor cortical plasticity contributes to spontaneous recovery after incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI), but the pathways underlying this remain poorly understood. We performed optogenetic mapping of motor cortex in channelrhodopsin-2 expressing mice to assess the capacity of the cortex to re-establish motor output longitudinally after a C3/C4 dorsal column SCI that bilaterally ablated the dorsal corticospinal tract (CST) containing ∼96% of corticospinal fibers but spared ∼3% of CST fibers that project via the dorsolateral funiculus. Optogenetic mapping revealed extensive early deficits, but eventual reestablishment of motor cortical output maps to the limbs at the same latency as preoperatively by 4 weeks after injury. Analysis of skilled locomotion on the horizontal ladder revealed early deficits followed by partial spontaneous recovery by 6 weeks after injury. To dissociate between the contributions of injured dorsal projecting versus spared dorsolateral projecting corticospinal neurons, we established a transient silencing approach to inactivate spared dorsolaterally projecting corticospinal neurons specifically by injecting adeno-associated virus (AAV)-expressing Cre-dependent DREADD (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug) receptor hM4Di in sensorimotor cortex and AAV-expressing Cre in C7/C8 dorsolateral funiculus. Transient silencing uninjured dorsolaterally projecting corticospinal neurons via activation of the inhibitory DREADD receptor hM4Di abrogated spontaneous recovery and resulted in a greater change in skilled locomotion than in control uninjured mice using the same silencing approach. These data demonstrate the pivotal role of a minor dorsolateral corticospinal pathway in mediating spontaneous recovery after SCI and support a focus on spared corticospinal neurons as a target for therapy. Spontaneous recovery can occur after incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI), but the pathways underlying this remain poorly understood. We performed optogenetic mapping of motor cortex after a cervical SCI that interrupts most corticospinal transmission but results in partial recovery on a horizontal ladder task of sensorimotor function. We demonstrate that the motor cortex can reestablish output to the limbs longitudinally. To dissociate the roles of injured and uninjured corticospinal neurons in mediating recovery, we transiently silenced the minor dorsolateral corticospinal pathway spared by our injury. This abrogated spontaneous recovery and resulted in a greater change in skilled locomotion than in uninjured mice using the same approach. Therefore, uninjured corticospinal neurons substantiate remarkable motor cortical plasticity and partial recovery after SCI.},

  abstract        = {It has become well accepted that Huntington disease (HD) is associated with impaired glutamate uptake, resulting in a prolonged time-course of extracellular glutamate that contributes to excitotoxicity. However, the data supporting this view come largely from work in synaptosomes, which may overrepresent nerve-terminal uptake over astrocytic uptake. Here, we quantify real-time glutamate dynamics in HD mouse models by high-speed imaging of an intensity-based glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporter (iGluSnFR) and electrophysiological recordings of synaptically activated transporter currents in astrocytes. These techniques reveal a disconnect between the results obtained in synaptosomes and those in situ. Exogenous glutamate uptake is impaired in synaptosomes, whereas real-time measures of glutamate clearance in the HD striatum are normal or even accelerated, particularly in the aggressive R6/2 model. Our results highlight the importance of quantifying glutamate dynamics under endogenous release conditions, and suggest that the widely cited uptake impairment in HD does not contribute to pathogenesis.},

  abstract        = {Mouse head-fixed behaviour coupled with functional imaging has become a powerful technique in rodent systems neuroscience. However, training mice can be time consuming and is potentially stressful for animals. Here we report a fully automated, open source, self-initiated head-fixation system for mesoscopic functional imaging in mice. The system supports five mice at a time and requires minimal investigator intervention. Using genetically encoded calcium indicator transgenic mice, we longitudinally monitor cortical functional connectivity up to 24 h per day in >7,000 self-initiated and unsupervised imaging sessions up to 90 days. The procedure provides robust assessment of functional cortical maps on the basis of both spontaneous activity and brief sensory stimuli such as light flashes. The approach is scalable to a number of remotely controlled cages that can be assessed within the controlled conditions of dedicated animal facilities. We anticipate that home-cage brain imaging will permit flexible and chronic assessment of mesoscale cortical function.},

Furthermore, existing sensors, in particular those that measure calcium (genetically encoded calcium indicators; GECIs), largely monitor suprathreshold activity. Using a genetically encoded sensor of extracellular glutamate and in vivo mesoscopic imaging, we demonstrate rapid kinetics of virally transduced or transgenically expressed glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporter iGluSnFR. In both awake and anesthetized mice, we imaged an 8 × 8 mm field of view through an intact transparent skull preparation. iGluSnFR revealed cortical representation of sensory stimuli with rapid kinetics that were also reflected in correlation maps of spontaneous cortical activities at frequencies up to the alpha band (8-12 Hz). iGluSnFR resolved temporal features of sensory processing such as an intracortical reverberation during the processing of visual stimuli. The kinetics of iGluSnFR for reporting regional cortical signals were more rapid than those for Emx-GCaMP3 and GCaMP6s and comparable to the temporal responses seen with RH1692 voltage sensitive dye (VSD), with similar signal amplitude. Regional cortical connectivity detected by iGluSnFR in spontaneous brain activity identified functional circuits consistent with maps generated from GCaMP3 mice, GCaMP6s mice, or VSD sensors. Viral and transgenic iGluSnFR tools have potential utility in normal physiology, as well as neurologic and psychiatric pathologies in which abnormalities in glutamatergic signaling are implicated. We have characterized the usage of virally transduced or transgenically expressed extracellular glutamate sensor iGluSnFR to perform wide-field-of-view mesoscopic imaging of cortex in both anesthetized and awake mice. Probes for neurotransmitter concentration enable monitoring of brain activity and provide a more direct measure of regional functional activity that is less dependent on nonlinearities associated with voltage-gated ion channels. We demonstrate functional maps of extracellular glutamate concentration and that this sensor has rapid kinetics that enable reporting high-frequency signaling. This imaging strategy has utility in normal physiology and pathologies in which altered glutamatergic signaling is observed. Moreover, we provide comparisons between iGluSnFR and genetically encoded calcium indicators and voltage-sensitive dyes.},

Direct optogenetic cortical stimulation in the sensorimotor cortex of transgenic mice expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 in GABAergic neurons (VGAT-ChR2) greatly attenuated spontaneous cortical spikes, but was sufficient to increase blood flow as measured with laser speckle contrast imaging. To determine whether the observed optogenetically evoked gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-neuron hemodynamic responses were dependent on ionotropic glutamatergic or GABAergic synaptic mechanisms, we paired optogenetic stimulation with application of antagonists to the cortex. Incubation of glutamatergic antagonists directly on the cortex (NBQX and MK-801) blocked cortical sensory evoked responses (as measured with electroencephalography and intrinsic optical signal imaging), but did not significantly attenuate optogenetically evoked hemodynamic responses. Significant light-evoked hemodynamic responses were still present after the addition of picrotoxin (GABA-A receptor antagonist) in the presence of the glutamatergic synaptic blockade. This activation of cortical inhibitory interneurons can mediate large changes in blood flow in a manner that is by and large not dependent on ionotropic glutamatergic or GABAergic synaptic transmission. This supports the hypothesis that activation of inhibitory neurons can increase local cerebral blood flow in a manner that is not entirely dependent on levels of net ongoing neuronal activity.},

  abstract        = {Animals are constantly exposed to the time-varying visual world. Because visual perception is modulated by immediately prior visual experience, visual cortical neurons may register recent visual history into a specific form of offline activity and link it to later visual input. To examine how preceding visual inputs interact with upcoming information at the single neuron level, we designed a simple stimulation protocol in which a brief, orientated flashing stimulus was subsequently coupled to visual stimuli with identical or different features. Using in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recording and functional two-photon calcium imaging from the primary visual cortex (V1) of awake mice, we discovered that a flash of sinusoidal grating per se induces an early, transient activation as well as a long-delayed reactivation in V1 neurons. This late response, which started hundreds of milliseconds after the flash and persisted for approximately 2 s, was also observed in human V1 electroencephalogram. When another drifting grating stimulus arrived during the late response, the V1 neurons exhibited a sublinear, but apparently increased response, especially to the same grating orientation. In behavioral tests of mice and humans, the flashing stimulation enhanced the detection power of the identically orientated visual stimulation only when the second stimulation was presented during the time window of the late response. Therefore, V1 late responses likely provide a neural basis for admixing temporally separated stimuli and extracting identical features in time-varying visual environments.},

We outline how to apply regional, functional network analysis to mesoscale optical imaging using voltage-sensitive-dye imaging and channelrhodopsin-2 stimulation in a mouse model. We include links to sample datasets and an analysis script. The analyses we employ can be applied to other types of fluorescence wide-field imaging, including genetically encoded calcium indicators, to assess network properties. We discuss the benefits and limitations of using network analysis for interpreting optical imaging data and define network properties that may be used to compare across preparations or other manipulations such as animal models of disease.},

Here we show, using wide-field, voltage-sensitive dye imaging, the mesoscale spatiotemporal structure and pharmacological dependence of spontaneous, infraslow cortical activity in anaesthetized and awake mice. Spontaneous infraslow activity is regionally distinct, correlates with electroencephalography and local field potential recordings, and shows bilateral symmetry between cortical hemispheres. Infraslow activity is attenuated and its functional structure abolished after treatment with voltage-gated sodium channel and glutamate receptor antagonists. Correlation analysis reveals patterns of infraslow regional connectivity that are analogous to cortical motifs observed from higher-frequency spontaneous activity and reflect the underlying framework of intracortical axonal projections.},

Here we show in rats that NMDA-induced vasodilation and hemodynamic responses evoked by whisker stimulation involve cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity and activation of the prostaglandin E2 (PgE2) receptors EP2 and EP4. Using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that PgE2 is released by NMDA in cortical slices. The characterization of PgE2 producing cells by immunohistochemistry and single-cell reverse transcriptase-PCR revealed that pyramidal cells and not astrocytes are the main cell type equipped for PgE2 synthesis, one third expressing COX-2 systematically associated with a PgE2 synthase. Consistent with their central role in NVC, in vivo optogenetic stimulation of pyramidal cells evoked COX-2-dependent hyperemic responses in mice. These observations identify PgE2 as the main prostaglandin mediating sensory-evoked NVC, pyramidal cells as their principal source and vasodilatory EP2 and EP4 receptors as their targets. Brain function critically depends on a permanent spatiotemporal match between neuronal activity and blood supply, known as NVC. In the cerebral cortex, prostaglandins are major contributors to NVC. However, their biochemical identity remains elusive and their cellular origins are still under debate. Although astrocytes can induce vasodilations through the release of prostaglandins, the recruitment of this pathway during sensory stimulation is questioned. Using multidisciplinary approaches from single-cell reverse transcriptase-PCR, mass spectrometry, to ex vivo and in vivo pharmacology and optogenetics, we provide compelling evidence identifying PgE2 as the main prostaglandin in NVC, pyramidal neurons as their main cellular source and the vasodilatory EP2 and EP4 receptors as their main targets. These original findings will certainly change the current view of NVC.},

Given the short latency to ischemic depolarization (∼2 min), we have found it necessary to develop ischemia models that can be initiated while the animal is within the two-photon microscope for in vivo imaging. We describe both a global ischemia model and a targeted photothrombotic ischemia model in green fluorescent protein- and yellow fluorescent protein-expressing transgenic mice in which in vivo imaging of dendritic structure can be performed. The advantage of the global model is the speed with which ischemia can be induced and reversed, whereas the focal model lacks precise temporal control but can be targeted to a select region.},

Microocclusions in the hippocampus produce cell loss or neuronal atrophy (~7% of lodged microspheres led to microinfarcts), while axons within white matter tracts, as well as the striatum and thalamus became blebbed or disrupted. Although the neocortex contained more occlusions than other structures, labeled layer 5 neurons were relatively resistant to structural damage, with <2% of the lodged microspheres producing obvious neuronal damage.},

  abstract        = {Relatively few studies have examined plasticity of inhibitory neuronal networks following stroke in vivo, primarily due to the inability to selectively monitor inhibition. We assessed the structure of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons during a 5 min period of global ischemia and reperfusion in mice, which mimicked cerebral ischemia during cardiac arrest or forms of transient ischemic attack. The dendritic structure of PV-neurons in cortical superficial layers was rapidly swollen and beaded during global ischemia, but recovered within 5-10 min following reperfusion. Using optogenetics and a multichannel optrode, we investigated the function of PV-neurons in mouse forelimb somatosensory cortex. We demonstrated pharmacologically that PV-channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) stimulation evoked activation in layer IV/V, which resulted in rapid current sinks mediated by photocurrent and action potentials (a measure of PV-neuron excitability), which was then followed by current sources mediated by network GABAergic synaptic activity. During ischemic depolarization, the PV-ChR2-evoked current sinks (excitability) were suppressed, but recovered rapidly following reperfusion concurrent with repolarization of the DC-EEG. In contrast, the current sources reflecting GABAergic synaptic network activity recovered slowly and incompletely, and was coincident with the partial recovery of the forepaw stimulation-evoked current sinks in layer IV/V 30 min post reperfusion. Our in vivo data suggest that the excitability of PV inhibitory neurons was suppressed during global ischemia and rapidly recovered during reperfusion. In contrast, PV-ChR2 stimulation-evoked GABAergic synaptic network activity exhibited a prolonged suppression even ∼1 h after reperfusion, which could contribute to the dysfunction of sensation and cognition following transient global ischemia.},

  abstract        = {We used arbitrary point channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) stimulation and wide-scale voltage sensitive dye (VSD) imaging in mice to map altered cortical connectivity at 1 and 8 weeks after a targeted cortical stroke. Network analysis based on optogenetic stimulation revealed a symmetrical sham network with distinct sensorimotor and association groupings. This symmetry was disrupted after stroke: at 1 week after stroke, we observed a widespread depression of optogenetically evoked activity that extended to the non-injured hemisphere; by 8 weeks, significant recovery was observed. When we considered the network as a whole, scaling the ChR2-evoked VSD responses from the stroke groups to match the sham group mean resulted in a relative distribution of responses that was indistinguishable from the sham group, suggesting network-wide down-scaling and connectional diaschisis after stroke. Closer inspection revealed that connections that had little connectivity with the peri-infarct, such as contralateral visual areas, tended to escape damage, whereas some connections near the peri-infarct were more severely affected. When connections within the peri-infarct were isolated, we did not observe equal down-scaling of responses after stroke. Peri-infarct sites that had weak connection strength in the sham condition tended to have the greatest relative post-stroke recovery. Our findings suggest that, during recovery, most cortical areas undergo homeostatic upscaling, resulting in a relative distribution of responses that is similar to the pre-stroke (sham) network, albeit still depressed. However, recovery within the peri-infarct zone is heterogeneous and these cortical points do not follow the recovery scaling factor expected for the entire network.},

Some connections can recover with prompt reperfusion; others associated with the dying infarct do not. Disruption in functional connectivity is due to direct tissue loss and indirect disconnections of remote areas known as diaschisis. Stroke is devastating, yet given the brain's redundant design, collateral surviving networks and their connections are well-positioned to compensate. Our perspective is that new treatments for stroke may involve a rational functional and structural connections-based approach. Surviving, affected, and at-risk networks can be identified and targeted with scenario-specific treatments. Strategies for recovery may include functional inhibition of the intact hemisphere, rerouting of connections, or setpoint-mediated network plasticity. These approaches may be guided by brain imaging and enabled by patient- and injury-specific brain stimulation, rehabilitation, and potential molecule-based strategies to enable new connections.},

  abstract        = {Transgenic mice expressing genetically encoded activity indicators are an attractive means of mapping mesoscopic regional functional cortical connectivity given widespread stable and cell-specific expression compatible with chronic recordings. Cortical functional connectivity was evaluated using wide-field imaging in lightly anesthetized Emx1-creXRosa26-GCaMP3 mice expressing calcium sensor in cortical neurons. Challenges exist because green fluorescence signals overlap with endogenous activity-dependent autofluorescence and are affected by changes in blood volume and oxygenation. Under the conditions used for imaging and analysis (0.1-1 Hz frequency band), autofluorescence and hemodynamic effects contributed 3% and 8% of the SD of spontaneous activity-dependent GCaMP3 fluorescence when signals were recorded through intact bone. To evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of this approach, the topology of functional connections between somatomotor cortex (primary S1 and secondary S2 somatosensory, and primary motor cortex M1) was estimated. During sequences of spontaneous activity, calcium signals recorded at each location of area S1 were correlated with activity in contralateral area S1, ipsilateral area S2, and bilateral areas M1. Reciprocal results were observed when "seed pixels" were placed in S2 and M1. Coactivation of areas implies functional connections but could also be attributed to both regions receiving common upstream drive. These apparent connections revealed during spontaneous activity coactivation by GCaMP3 were confirmed by intracortical microstimulation but were more difficult to detect using intrinsic signals from reflected red light. We anticipate GCAMP wide-field imaging will enable longitudinal studies during plasticity paradigms or after models of CNS disease, such as stroke, where the weighting within these connectivity maps may be altered.},

Using optogenetics, we directly assessed both the excitability and motor output of cortical neurons in a manner independent of behavioral state or training. Occlusion of individual arterioles within the motor cortex led to a ministroke that was verified using laser speckle contrast imaging. Surprisingly, ministrokes targeted to a relatively small region of the forelimb motor map, with an ischemic core of 0.07 ± 0.03 mm(2), impaired motor responses evoked from points across widespread areas of motor cortex even 1.5 mm away. Contrasting averaged ChR2-evoked electroencephalographic, spinal (ChR2 evoked potential), and electromyographic responses revealed a mismatch between measures of cortical excitability and motor output within 60 min after stroke. This mismatch suggests that apparently excitable cortical neurons (even >1 mm into peri-infarct areas, away from the infarct core) were impaired in their capacity to generate spinal potentials leading to even more severe deficits in motor output at muscles. We suggest that ischemia, targeted to a subset of motor cortex, leads to relatively small reductions in excitability within motor cortex, and cumulative depression of both descending spinal circuits and motor output in response to the activation of widespread cortical territories even outside of the area directly affected by the ischemia.},

To study the functional organization of sensorimotor cortex at multiple time points before and after stroke, we performed longitudinal light-based motor mapping of transgenic mice expressing light-sensitive channelrhodopsin-2 in layer 5 cortical neurons. Pulses of light stimulation were targeted to an array of cortical points, whereas evoked forelimb motor activity was recorded using noninvasive motion sensors. Intrinsic optical signal imaging produced maps of the forelimb somatosensory cortex. The resulting motor and sensory maps were repeatedly generated for weeks before and after small (0.2 mm3) photothrombotic infarcts were targeted to forelimb motor or sensory cortex. Infarcts targeted to forelimb sensory or motor areas caused decreased motor output in the infarct area and spatial displacement of sensory and motor maps. Strokes in sensory cortex caused the sensory map to move into motor cortex, which adopted a more diffuse structure. Stroke in motor cortex caused a compensatory increase in peri-infarct motor output, but did not affect the position or excitability of sensory maps. After stroke in motor cortex, decreased motor output from the infarcted area was offset by peri-infarct excitability. Sensory stroke caused a new sensory map to form in motor cortex, which maintained its center position, despite becoming more diffuse. These data suggest that surviving regions of cortex are able to assume functions from stroke-damaged areas, although this may come at the cost of alterations in map structure.},

  abstract        = {Recently we have shown that despite reperfusion, sensory processing exhibits persistent deficits after global ischemia in a mouse in vivo model. We now address how motor output, specifically cortically evoked muscle activity, stimulated by channelrhodopsin-2 is affected by global ischemia and reperfusion. We find that the light-based optogenetic motor map recovers to 80% within an hour. Moreover, motor output recovers relatively faster and more completely than the sensory processing after 5-minute period of global ischemia. Our results suggest a differential sensitivity of sensory and motor systems to the effects of global ischemia and reperfusion that may have implications for rehabilitation.},

These motifs can reflect multiple modes of sensory processing, including vision, audition and touch. We found similar cortical networks with direct cortical activation using channelrhodopsin-2. Regional analysis of activity spread indicated modality-specific sources, such as primary sensory areas, a common posterior-medial cortical sink where sensory activity was extinguished within the parietal association area and a secondary anterior medial sink within the cingulate and secondary motor cortices for visual stimuli. Correlation analysis between functional circuits and intracortical axonal projections indicated a common framework corresponding to long-range monosynaptic connections between cortical regions. Maps of intracortical monosynaptic structural connections predicted hemisphere-wide patterns of spontaneous and sensory-evoked depolarization. We suggest that an intracortical monosynaptic connectome shapes the ebb and flow of spontaneous cortical activity.},

Here we present a refined set of procedures for repeated light-based motor mapping in ChR2-expressing mice implanted with a bilateral thinned-skull chronic window and a chronically implanted electroencephalogram (EEG) electrode. Light stimulation is delivered sequentially to over 400 points across the cortex, and evoked movements are quantified on-line with a three-axis accelerometer attached to each forelimb. Bilateral maps of forelimb movement amplitude and movement direction were generated at weekly intervals after recovery from cranial window implantation. We found that light pulses of ~2 mW produced well-defined maps that were centered approximately 0.7 mm anterior and 1.6 mm lateral from bregma. Map borders were defined by sites where light stimulation evoked EEG deflections, but not movements. Motor maps were similar in size and location between mice, and maps were stable over weeks in terms of the number of responsive sites, and the direction of evoked movements. We suggest that our method may be used to chronically assess evoked motor output in mice, and may be combined with other imaging tools to assess cortical reorganization or sensory-motor integration.},

  abstract     = {To better understand the connectivity of the brain, it is important to map both structural and functional connections between neurons and cortical regions. In recent years, a set of optogenetic tools have been developed that permit selective manipulation and investigation of neural systems. These tools have enabled the mapping of functional connections between stimulated cortical targets and other brain regions. Advantages of the approach include the ability to arbitrarily stimulate brain regions that express opsins, allowing for brain mapping independent of behavior or sensory processing. The ability of opsins to be rapidly and locally activated allows for investigation of connectivity with spatial resolution on the order of single neurons and temporal resolution on the order of milliseconds. Optogenetic methods for functional mapping have been applied in experiments ranging from in vitro investigation of microcircuits, to in vivo probing of inter-regional cortical connections, to examination of global connections within the whole brain. We review recently developed functional mapping methods that use optogenetic single-point stimulation in the rodent brain and employ cellular electrophysiology, evoked motor movements, voltage sensitive dyes (VSDs), calcium indicators, or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess activity. In particular we highlight results using red-shifted organic VSDs that permit high temporal resolution imaging in a manner spectrally separated from Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) activation. VSD maps stimulated by ChR2 were dependent on intracortical synaptic activity and were able to reflect circuits used for sensory processing. Although the methods reviewed are powerful, challenges remain with respect to finding approaches that permit selective high temporal resolution assessment of stimulated activity in animals that can be followed longitudinally.},

  abstract     = {The firing rates of neurons in primate motor cortex have been related to multiple parameters of voluntary movement. This finding has been corroborated by stimulation-based studies that have mapped complex movements in rodent and primate motor cortex. However, it has been difficult to link the movement tuning of a neuron with its role within the cortical microcircuit. In sensory cortex, neuronal tuning is largely established by afferents delivering information from tuned receptors in the periphery. Motor cortex, which lacks the granular input layer, may be better understood by analyzing its efferent projections. As a primary source of cortical output, layer 5 neurons represent an ideal starting point for this line of experimentation. It is in these deep output layers that movements can most effectively be evoked by intracortical microstimulation and recordings can obtain the most useful signals for the control of motor prostheses. Studies focused on layer 5 output neurons have revealed that projection identity is a fundamental property related to the laminar position, receptive field and ion channel complement of these cells. Given the variety of brain areas targeted by layer 5 output neurons, knowledge of a neuron's downstream connectivity may provide insight into its movement tuning. Future experiments that relate motor behavior to the activity of neurons with a known projection identity will yield a more detailed understanding of the function of cortical microcircuits.},

Spontaneous, ChR2, or forepaw stimulation-evoked electroencephalogram (EEG) or local field potential (LFP) records were collected from the somatosensory cortex. Within 20 s of ischemia, a >90% depression of spontaneous 0.3-3 Hz EEG and LFP power was detected. Ischemic depolarization followed EEG depression with a ∼2 min delay. Surprisingly, neuronal excitability, as assessed by the ChR2-mediated EEG response, was intact during the period of strong spontaneous EEG suppression and actually increased before ischemic depolarization. In contrast, a decrease in the somatosensory-evoked potential (forepaw-evoked potential, reflecting cortical synaptic transmission) was coincident with the EEG suppression. After 5 min of ischemia, the animal was reperfused, and the ChR2-mediated response mostly recovered within 30 min (>80% of preischemia value). However, the recovery of the somatosensory-evoked potential was significantly delayed compared with the ChR2-mediated response (<40% of preischemia value at 60 min). By assessing intrinsic optical signals in combination with EEG, we found that neuronal excitability approached minimal values when the spreading ischemic depolarization wave propagated to the ChR2-stimulated cortex. Our results indicate that the ChR2-mediated EEG/LFP response recovers much faster than sensory-evoked EEG/LFP activity in vivo following ischemia and reperfusion, defining a period where excitable but synaptically silent neurons are present.},

  abstract        = {Spontaneous activity in the developing brain contributes to its maturation, but how this activity is coordinated between distinct cortical regions and whether it might reflect developing sensory circuits is not well understood. Here, we address this question by imaging the spread and synchronization of cortical activity using voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs) in the developing rat in vivo. In postnatal day 4-6 rats (n = 10), we collected spontaneous changes in VSD signal that reflect underlying membrane potential changes over a large craniotomy (50 mm2) that encompassed both the sensory and motor cortices of both hemispheres. Bursts of depolarization that occurred approximately once every 12 s were preceded by spontaneous twitches of the hindlimbs and/or tail. The close association with peripheral movements suggests that these bursts may represent a slow component of spindle bursts, a prominent form of activity in the developing somatosensory cortex. Twitch-associated cortical activity was synchronized between subregions of somatosensory cortex, which reflected the synchronized twitching of the limbs and tail. This activity also spread asymmetrically, toward the midline of the brain. We found that the spatial and temporal structure of such spontaneous cortical bursts closely matched that of sensory-evoked activity elicited via direct stimulation of the periphery. These data suggest that spontaneous cortical activity provides a recurring template of functional cortical circuits within the developing cortex and could contribute to the maturation of integrative connections between sensory and motor cortices.},

Prolonged trains of electrical or optogenetic stimulation (100-500 ms) targeted to anterior or posterior subregions of motor cortex evoked reproducible complex movements of the forelimb to distinct positions in space. Blocking excitatory cortical synaptic transmission did not abolish basic motor map topography, but the site-specific expression of complex movements was lost.

Hypothermic treatment promoted more consistent recovery of dendritic structure and spines during reperfusion.

Photostimulation of subsets of deep layer pyramidal neurons within forelimb, barrel, or visual primary sensory cortex led to downstream cortical maps that were dependent on synaptic transmission and were similar to peripheral sensory stimulation. ChR2-evoked maps confirmed homotopic connections between hemispheres and intracortical sensory and motor cortex connections. This ability of optogentically activated subpopulations of neurons to drive appropriate downstream maps suggests that mechanisms exist to allow prototypical cortical maps to self-assemble from the stimulation of neuronal subsets. Using this principle of map self-assembly, we employed ChR2 point stimulation to map connections between cortical areas that are not selectively activated by peripheral sensory stimulation or behavior. Representing the functional cortical regions as network nodes, we identified asymmetrical connection weights in individual nodes and identified the parietal association area as a network hub. Furthermore, we found that the strength of reciprocal intracortical connections between primary and secondary sensory areas are unequal, with connections from primary to secondary sensory areas being stronger than the reciprocal.},

  abstract        = {While strategies for handling unusual and possibly clinically significant anatomical findings on brain scans of research volunteers have been developed and implemented across neuroimaging laboratories worldwide, few concrete steps have been taken to consider the next frontier: functional anomalies. Drawing on the genetics literature, early work in neuroimaging considered actionability to be a driving force for determining if and when findings should be disclosed to individuals in whom they are detected, as inherent uncertainty raises potential ethical dilemmas of misdiagnosing and mislabelling people as patients. Here we consider the possibility of incidental findings in brain function during the resting state. Our approach does not anchor the resting state as the sine qua non of functional incidental findings, but as a path to thinking about where they may emerge in the future and how our professional communities need to think about thinking about them. We suggest that considering the issues proactively today, within a framework that is maximally flexible and open to modification, is better than responding reactively after the fact and with no framework at all. We argue that there is a duty to consider possible incidental findings despite the ambiguities of data interpretation, while working hard to prevent unnecessary alarm.},

Using transgenic mice expressing the light-activated cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 in deep layer pyramidal neurons, we report that changes in intrinsic optical signals and blood flow can be evoked by activation of a subset of channelrhodopsin-2-expressing neurons in the sensorimotor cortex. We have combined imaging and pharmacology to examine the importance of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in this form of neurovascular coupling. Blockade of ionotropic glutamate receptors with the antagonists CNQX and MK801 significantly reduced forepaw-evoked hemodynamic responses, yet resulted in no significant reduction of channelrhodopsin-evoked hemodynamic responses, suggesting that stimulus-dependent coupling of neuronal activity to blood flow can be independent of local excitatory synaptic transmission. Together, these results indicate that channelrhodopsin-2 activation of sensorimotor excitatory neurons produces changes in intrinsic optical signals and blood flow that can occur under conditions where synaptic activation of neurons or other cells through ionotropic glutamate receptors would be blocked.},

  abstract     = {Cortical neurons process information on a background of spontaneous, ongoing activity with distinct spatiotemporal profiles defining different cortical states. During wakefulness, cortical states alter constantly in relation to behavioral context, attentional level or general motor activity. In this review article, we will discuss our current understanding of cortical states in awake rodents, how they are controlled, their impact on sensory processing, and highlight areas for future research. A common observation in awake rodents is the rapid change in spontaneous cortical activity from high-amplitude, low-frequency (LF) fluctuations, when animals are quiet, to faster and smaller fluctuations when animals are active. This transition is typically thought of as a change in global brain state but recent work has shown variation in cortical states across regions, indicating the presence of a fine spatial scale control system. In sensory areas, the cortical state change is mediated by at least two convergent inputs, one from the thalamus and the other from cholinergic inputs in the basal forebrain. Cortical states have a major impact on the balance of activity between specific subtypes of neurons, on the synchronization between nearby neurons, as well as the functional coupling between distant cortical areas. This reorganization of the activity of cortical networks strongly affects sensory processing. Thus cortical states provide a dynamic control system for the moment-by-moment regulation of cortical processing.},

Task learning is accompanied by target-specific routing of sensory information to specific downstream cortical regions, with higher-order cortical regions such as the posterior parietal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus appearing to play important roles in learning- and context-dependent processing of sensory input.

Sensory-evoked signals were absent from medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus in naive mice, but developed with task learning and correlated with behavioral performance in mice trained in the detection task. The sensory responses in medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus occurred with short latencies of less than 50 ms after whisker deflection. Pharmacological and optogenetic inactivation of medial prefrontal cortex or dorsal hippocampus impaired behavioral performance. Neuronal activity in medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus thus appears to contribute directly to task performance, perhaps providing top-down control of learned, context-dependent transformation of sensory input into goal-directed motor output.},

However, little is known about the spatiotemporal organization of LF activities across cortical areas during wakefulness and to what extent it differs during NREM sleep. We have thus investigated the dynamics of LF activities across cortical areas in awake and sleeping mice using chronic simultaneous local field potential recordings. We found that LF activities had higher amplitude in somatosensory and motor areas during quiet wakefulness and decreased in most areas during active wakefulness, resulting in a global state change that was overall correlated with motor activity. However, we also observed transient desynchronization of cortical states between areas, indicating a more local state regulation. During NREM sleep, LF activities had higher amplitude in all areas but slow-wave activity was only poorly correlated across cortical areas. Despite a maximal amplitude during NREM sleep, the coherence of LF activities between areas that are not directly connected dropped from wakefulness to NREM sleep, potentially reflecting a breakdown of long-range cortical integration associated with loss of consciousness.},

Optogenetic stimulation of wM1 evokes rhythmic whisker protraction (whisking), whereas optogenetic inactivation of wM1 suppresses initiation of whisking. Whole-cell membrane potential recordings and silicon probe recordings of action potentials reveal layer-specific neuronal activity in wM1 at movement initiation, and encoding of fast and slow parameters of movements during whisking. Interestingly, optogenetic inactivation of wS1 caused hyperpolarization and reduced firing in wM1, together with reduced whisking. Optogenetic stimulation of wS1 drove activity in wM1 with complex dynamics, as well as evoking long-latency, wM1-dependent whisking. Our results advance understanding of a well-defined frontal region and point to an important role for sensory input in controlling motor cortex.},

Previously, we have shown that these firing patterns are not fixed and can change as a function of membrane potential and states of vigilance. Other studies have reported that extracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]o) fluctuates as a function of the phase of the cortical slow oscillation. In the present study we investigated how spontaneous and induced changes in [Ca(2+)]o affect the properties of action potentials (APs) and firing patterns in cortical neurons in vivo. Intracellular recordings were performed in cats anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine during spontaneous [Ca(2+)]o fluctuation and while changing [Ca(2+)]o with reverse microdialysis. When [Ca(2+)]o fluctuated spontaneously according to the phase of the slow oscillation, we found an increase of the firing threshold and a decrease of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude during the depolarizing (active, up) phase of the slow oscillation and some neurons also changed their firing pattern as compared with the hyperpolarizing (silent, down) phase. Induced changes in [Ca(2+)]o significantly affected the AP properties in all neurons. The AHP amplitude was increased in high calcium conditions and decreased in low calcium conditions, in particular the earliest components. Modulation of spike AHP resulted in notable modulation of intrinsic firing pattern and some RS neurons revealed burst firing when [Ca(2+)]o was decreased. We also found an increase in AHP amplitude in high [Ca(2+)]o with in vitro preparation. We suggest that during spontaneous network oscillations in vivo, the dynamic changes of firing patterns depend partially on fluctuations of the [Ca(2+)]o.},

Here, we used field potential and intracellular recordings in different cortical areas in the cat to directly compare properties of slow oscillation during natural sleep and ketamine-xylazine anesthesia. During SWS cortical activity showed higher power in the slow/delta (0.1-4 Hz) and spindle (8-14 Hz) frequency range, whereas under anesthesia the power in the gamma band (30-100 Hz) was higher. During anesthesia, slow waves were more rhythmic and more synchronous across the cortex. Intracellular recordings revealed that silent states were longer and the amplitude of membrane potential around transition between active and silent states was bigger under anesthesia. Slow waves were mostly uniform across cortical areas under anesthesia, but in SWS, they were most pronounced in associative and visual areas but smaller and less regular in somatosensory and motor cortices. We conclude that, although the main features of the slow oscillation in sleep and anesthesia appear similar, multiple cellular and network features are differently expressed during natural SWS compared with ketamine-xylazine anesthesia.},

We combined these two imaging techniques using epifluorescence optics together with whole cell recordings to measure the spatiotemporal dynamics of activity in the mouse somatosensory barrel cortex in vitro and in the supragranular layers in vivo. The two optical signals reported distinct aspects of cortical function. VSD fluorescence varied linearly with membrane potential and was dominated by subthreshold postsynaptic potentials, whereas the CaSD signal predominantly reflected local action potential firing. Combining VSDs and CaSDs allowed us to monitor the synaptic drive and the spiking activity of a given area at the same time in the same preparation. The spatial extent of the two dye signals was different, with VSD signals spreading further than CaSD signals, reflecting broad subthreshold and narrow suprathreshold receptive fields. Importantly, the signals from the dyes were differentially affected by pharmacological manipulations, stimulation strength, and depth of isoflurane anesthesia. Combined VSD and CaSD measurements can therefore be used to specify the temporal and spatial relationships between subthreshold and suprathreshold activity of the neocortex.},

Single-unit recordings during behavioural states were further used to determine the neuronal characteristics of these structures. We found that muscimol, a GABAA receptor agonist, induced a significant increase in paradoxical sleep (PS) only when applied to a dorsocaudal central tegmental field (dcFTC) located just beneath the ventrolateral periaqueductal grey. In this structure, both kainic and N-methyl-aspartic acids caused a dose-dependent increase in wakefulness (W) and decrease in both slow-wave sleep (SWS) and PS. Norepinephrine and epinephrine, and to a lesser extent histamine, also increased W and decreased SWS and PS, whereas serotonin, dopamine and carbachol, a cholinergic agonist, had no effect. Two types of neurones were recorded in this structure, those exhibiting a higher rate of tonic discharge during both W and PS compared with during SWS, and those showing a phasic increase in firing rate during both active W and PS. Both types of neurones showed a gradual increase in unit activity during PS. Our study demonstrated for the first time that the ventrolateral periaqueductal grey and dcFTC play different roles in behavioural state control, that the dcFTC neurones are critically involved in the inhibitory mechanisms of PS generation, playing a central part in its maintenance, and that these neurones are under the control of GABAergic, glutamatergic, adrenergic and histaminergic systems.},

Activation of this Gi/GO-protein-coupled receptor affects cognition, the sleep-wake cycle, obesity and epilepsy, which are physiological and pathological conditions that are the main focus of research into the therapeutic potential of selective H3 receptor ligands. This heterogeneity of targets can be reconciled partially by the fact that the histamine system constitutes one of the most important brain-activating systems and that H3 receptors regulate the activity of histamine and other neurotransmitter systems. Furthermore, the H3 receptor shows functional constitutive activity, polymorphisms in humans and rodents with a differential distribution of splice variants in the CNS, and potential coupling to different intracellular signal transduction mechanisms. In light of the genetic, pharmacological and functional complexity of the H3 receptor, the importance of the histamine system as a therapeutic target to control the sleep-wake cycle and cognitive disorders will be discussed.},

Quantitative and qualitative analysis of behavioral states and electroencephalogram showed that DA had no significant effect when applied to any part of the mesopontine tegmentum, except the peri-locus coeruleus alpha, a region located just ventromedial to the locus coeruleus, pars alpha, and critically implicated in PS generation. In this structure, DA caused a selective and dose-dependent inhibition of PS and induced PS without atonia. These effects were not mimicked by SKF-81297, a selective D1-like agonist, or selective D2-like agonists such as quinelorane, quinpirole, and 7-OH-DPAT. Instead, D2-like agonists induced a significant decrease in wakefulness and increases in both slow-wave sleep and PS. The effects of DA were mimicked, however, by application of clonidine, a selective alpha2 adrenoceptor agonist, and blocked by co-application of RX821002, a selective antagonist of alpha2 adrenoceptors. Our results indicate that DA inhibits PS in the peri-locus coeruleus alpha via excitation of alpha2 adrenoceptors, but application of D2-like agonists to the same region markedly decreases wakefulness and increases both slow-wave sleep and PS. This effect may be responsible for the excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep attacks induced by antiparkinsonian dopaminergic agents.},

R* is promoted by agonists or occurs spontaneously, leading to constitutive activity of the receptor. Conversely, inverse agonists promote R and decrease constitutive activity. The existence of another pharmacological entity, referred to as "protean" agonists (after Proteus, the Greek god who could change shape), was assumed on theoretical grounds. It was predicted from the existence of constitutive activity that a same ligand of this class could act either as an agonist or an inverse agonist at the same GPCR. Here, we show that proxyfan, a high-affinity histamine H3-receptor ligand, acts as a protean agonist at recombinant H3 receptors expressed in the same Chinese hamster ovary cells. In support of the physiological relevance of the process, we show that proxyfan also behaves as a protean agonist at native H3 receptors known to display constitutive activity. On neurochemical and behavioral responses in rodents and cats, proxyfan displays a spectrum of activity ranging from full agonism to full inverse agonism. Thus, protean agonism demonstrates the existence of ligand-directed active states LR* different from, and competing with, constitutively active states R* of GPCRs, and defines a pharmacological entity with important therapeutic implications.},

However, the lack of visual control makes this task difficult and inaccurate, especially when targeting small and deep regions where spillover to neighboring regions is likely to occur. An additional problem with recording stability arises when combining focal drug administration with in vivo intracellular recordings, which are highly sensitive to mechanical vibrations. To address these technical issues, we designed a micro-holder that enables accurate local application of pharmacological agents during in vivo whole-cell recordings. The holder couples the recording and drug delivery pipettes with adjustable distance between the respective tips adapted to the experimental needs. To test the efficacy of the micro-holder we first performed whole-cell recordings in mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1) with simultaneous extracellular recordings in S1 and motor cortex (M1), before and after local application of bicuculline methiodide (BMI 200 µM). The blockade of synaptic inhibition resulted in increased amplitudes and rising slopes of "Up states", and shortening of their duration. We then checked the usability of the micro-holder in a deeper brain structure, the striatum. We applied tetrodotoxin (TTX 10 µM) during whole-cell recordings in the striatum, while simultaneously obtaining extracellular recordings in S1 and M1. The focal application of TTX in the striatum blocked Up states in the recorded striatal neurons, without affecting the cortical activity. We also describe two different approaches for precisely releasing the drugs without unwanted leakage along the pipette approach trajectory.},

Whereas ipsilateral corticostriatal projections are prevalent throughout the neocortex, contralateral projections provide sparse input from primary sensory cortices, in contrast to the dense innervation from motor and frontal regions. There is, therefore, an apparent discrepancy between the observed anatomical pathways and the recorded striatal responses. We used simultaneous in vivo whole-cell and extracellular recordings combined with focal cortical silencing, to dissect the afferent pathways underlying bilateral sensory integration in the mouse striatum. We show that unlike direct corticostriatal projections mediating responses to contralateral whisker deflection, responses to ipsilateral stimuli are mediated mainly by intracortical projections from the contralateral somatosensory cortex (S1). The dominant pathway is the callosal projection from contralateral to ipsilateral S1. Our results suggest a functional difference between the cortico-basal ganglia pathways underlying bilateral sensory and motor processes.},

  abstract        = {The basal ganglia are involved in sensorimotor functions and action selection, both of which require the integration of sensory information. In order to determine how such sensory inputs are integrated, we obtained whole-cell recordings in mouse dorsal striatum during presentation of tactile and visual stimuli. All recorded neurons responded to bilateral whisker stimulation, and a subpopulation also responded to visual stimulation. Neurons responding to both visual and tactile stimuli were located in dorsomedial striatum, whereas those responding only to whisker deflections were located dorsolaterally. Responses were mediated by overlapping excitation and inhibition, with excitation onset preceding that of inhibition by several milliseconds. Responses differed according to the type of neuron, with direct pathway MSNs having larger responses and longer latencies between ipsilateral and contralateral responses than indirect pathway MSNs. Our results suggest that striatum acts as a sensory "hub" with specialized functional roles for the different neuron types.},

  abstract        = {EphA4 signaling is essential for the spatiotemporal organization of neuronal circuit formation. In mice, deletion of this signaling pathway causes aberrant midline crossing of axons from both brain and spinal neurons and the complete knock-outs (KOs) exhibit a pronounced change in motor behavior, where alternating gaits are replaced by a rabbit-like hopping gait. The neuronal mechanism that is responsible for the gait switch in these KO mice is not known. Here, using intersectional genetics, we demonstrate that a spinal cord-specific deletion of EphA4 signaling is sufficient to generate the overground hopping gait. In contrast, selective deletion of EphA4 signaling in forebrain neurons, including the corticospinal tract neurons, did not result in a change in locomotor pattern. The gait switch was attributed to the loss of EphA4 signaling in excitatory Vglut2+ neurons, which is accompanied by an increased midline crossing of Vglut2+ neurons in the ventral spinal cord. Our findings functionally define spinal EphA4 signaling in excitatory Vglut2+ neurons as required for proper organization of the spinal locomotor circuitry, and place these cells as essential components of the mammalian locomotor network.},

An additional requirement was to be non-invasive in order to be usable in awake chronically implanted rats without inducing stress. With that aim, electrophysiological recordings from the barrel cortex of anesthetized rats were obtained. The pressure of an air-puff (5-10 ms) delivered to the whiskers was adjusted to evoke a consistent response of around 100 microV (extracellular) or approximately 5 mV (intracellular) in the contralateral cortex. Lidocaine was then locally applied in different forms (cream, local injection, aerosol, drops) and concentrations (2-10%) to the base of the whiskers. The stimulus-induced response was monitored once every 5s for several hours (3-6h) in order to characterize its course of action. Local injection of lidocaine induced the fastest and most complete blockage, but was ruled out for being invasive. Out of the remaining forms of application, a lidocaine drop (0.4 ml, 10%) to the base of the whiskers was found to induce a reliable blockage (to an average 9% the original response). The maximum effect was reached after 150-200 min, and the response was totally recovered approximately 300 min after lidocaine application. This characterization should be useful to induce an efficient, short term and reversible blockage of whisker sensory transmission in both anesthetized and awake preparations, while not causing stress in an awake animal.},

  abstract        = {High-frequency oscillations in cortical networks have been linked to a variety of cognitive and perceptual processes. They have also been recorded in small cortical slices in vitro, indicating that neuronal synchronization at these frequencies is generated in the local cortical circuit. However, in vitro experiments have hitherto necessitated exogenous pharmacological or electrical stimulation to generate robust synchronized activity in the beta/gamma range. Here, we demonstrate that the isolated cortical microcircuitry generates beta and gamma oscillations spontaneously in the absence of externally applied neuromodulators or synaptic agonists. We show this in a spontaneously active slice preparation that engages in slow oscillatory activity similar to activity during slow-wave sleep. beta and gamma synchronization appeared during the up states of the slow oscillation. Simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recordings revealed synchronization between the timing of incoming synaptic events and population activity. This rhythm was mechanistically similar to pharmacologically induced gamma rhythms, as it also included sparse, irregular firing of neurons within the population oscillation, predominant involvement of inhibitory neurons, and a decrease of oscillation frequency after barbiturate application. Finally, we show in a computer model how a synaptic loop between excitatory and inhibitory neurons can explain the emergence of both the slow (<1 Hz) and the beta-range oscillations in the neocortical network. We therefore conclude that oscillations in the beta/gamma range that share mechanisms with activity reported in vivo or in pharmacologically activated in vitro preparations can be generated during slow oscillatory activity in the local cortical circuit, even without exogenous pharmacological or electrical stimulation.},

Here, we investigated the extent and organizational principles governing pyramidal cell heterogeneity throughout the mouse subiculum. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we find that the subiculum pyramidal cell population can be deconstructed into eight separable subclasses. These subclasses were mapped onto abutting spatial domains, ultimately producing a complex laminar and columnar organization with heterogeneity across classical dorsal-ventral, proximal-distal, and superficial-deep axes. We further show that these transcriptomically defined subclasses correspond to differential protein products and can be associated with specific projection targets. This work deconstructs the complex landscape of subiculum pyramidal cells into spatially segregated subclasses that may be observed, controlled, and interpreted in future experiments.},

We report a third mechanism involving temporal integration of neural activity by a network of astrocytes. Previously, we showed that some types of interneurons can generate long-lasting trains of action potentials (barrage firing) following repeated depolarizing stimuli. Here we show that calcium signaling in an astrocytic network correlates with barrage firing; that active depolarization of astrocyte networks by chemical or optogenetic stimulation enhances; and that chelating internal calcium, inhibiting release from internal stores, or inhibiting GABA transporters or metabotropic glutamate receptors inhibits barrage firing. Thus, networks of astrocytes influence the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural networks by directly integrating neural activity and driving barrages of action potentials in some populations of inhibitory interneurons.},

Moreover, the two neuron types have distinct morphological and physiological phenotypes and are differentially modulated by acetylcholine. To understand the contribution of these athorny pyramid neurons to circuit function, we measured cell-type-specific firing patterns during sharp-wave synchronization events in vivo and recapitulated these dynamics with an attractor network model comprising two principal cell types. Our data and simulations reveal a key role for athorny cell bursting in the initiation of sharp waves: transient network attractor states that signify the execution of pattern completion computations vital to cognitive function.},

The biophysical mechanisms underlying this nonlinear cellular computation are unknown. Here, through a combination of in vitro, in vivo, and in silico approaches, we show that persistent sodium current mediates the strong membrane potential dependence of place cell activity. This current operates at membrane potentials below the action potential threshold and over seconds-long timescales, mediating a powerful and rapidly reversible amplification of synaptic responses, which drives place cell firing.

We sought to identify, delineate, and manipulate this putatively parallel architecture in the dorsal subiculum, the primary output subfield of the dorsal hippocampus. Population and single-cell RNA-seq revealed that the subiculum can be divided into two spatially adjacent subregions associated with prominent differences in pyramidal cell gene expression. Pyramidal cells occupying these two regions differed in their long-range inputs, local wiring, projection targets, and electrophysiological properties. Leveraging gene-expression differences across these regions, we use genetically restricted neuronal silencing to show that these regions differentially contribute to spatial working memory.

Feature-selective firing of these neurons results from the dendritic integration of inputs from multiple brain regions. While it is known that synchronous activation of spatially clustered inputs can contribute to firing through the generation of dendritic spikes, there is no established mechanism for spatiotemporal synaptic clustering. Here we show that single presynaptic axons form multiple, spatially clustered inputs onto the distal, but not proximal, dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. These compound connections exhibit ultrastructural features indicative of strong synapses and occur much more commonly in entorhinal than in thalamic afferents. Computational simulations revealed that compound connections depolarize dendrites in a biophysically efficient manner, owing to their inherent spatiotemporal clustering. Our results suggest that distinct afferent projections use different connectivity motifs that differentially contribute to dendritic integration.},

  abstract        = {Elucidating the diversity and spatial organization of cell types in the brain is an essential goal of neuroscience, with many emerging technologies helping to advance this endeavor. Using a new in situ hybridization method that can measure the expression of hundreds of genes in a given mouse brain section (amplified seqFISH), Shah et al. (2016) describe a spatial organization of hippocampal cell types that differs from previous reports. In seeking to understand this discrepancy, we find that many of the barcoded genes used by seqFISH to characterize this spatial organization, when cross-validated by other sensitive methodologies, exhibit negligible expression in the hippocampus. Additionally, the results of Shah et al. (2016) do not recapitulate canonical cellular hierarchies and improperly classify major neuronal cell types. We suggest that, when describing the spatial organization of brain regions, cross-validation using multiple techniques should be used to yield robust and informative cellular classification.

Moreover, for the canonical cell classes of the trisynaptic loop, we profiled transcriptomes at both dorsal and ventral poles, producing a cell-class- and region-specific transcriptional description for these populations. This dataset clarifies the transcriptional properties and identities of lesser-known cell classes, and moreover reveals unexpected variation in the trisynaptic loop across the dorsal-ventral axis.

The diversity of GABAergic interneurons is a hallmark of cortical circuits, yet little is known about their targeting to individual postsynaptic dendrites. We examined synaptic connectivity between molecularly defined inhibitory interneurons and CA1 pyramidal cell dendrites using correlative light-electron microscopy and large-volume array tomography. We show that interneurons can be highly selective in their connectivity to specific dendritic branch types and, furthermore, exhibit precisely targeted connectivity to the origin or end of individual branches. Computational simulations indicate that the observed subcellular targeting enables control over the nonlinear integration of synaptic input or the initiation and backpropagation of action potentials in a branch-selective manner. Our results demonstrate that connectivity between interneurons and pyramidal cell dendrites is more precise and spatially segregated than previously appreciated, which may be a critical determinant of how inhibition shapes dendritic computation.},

This approach has proven difficult in neuroscience due to the marked diversity across different neuron classes, but it may be further hampered by prominent within-class variability. Here, we considered a well-defined canonical neuronal population—hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (CA1 PCs)—and systematically examined the extent and spatial rules of transcriptional heterogeneity. Using next-generation RNA sequencing, we identified striking variability in CA1 PCs, such that the differences within CA1 along the dorsal-ventral axis rivaled differences across distinct pyramidal neuron classes. This variability emerged from a spectrum of continuous gene-expression gradients, producing a transcriptional profile consistent with a multifarious continuum of cells. This work reveals an unexpected amount of variability within a canonical and narrowly defined neuronal population and suggests that continuous, within-class heterogeneity may be an important feature of neural circuits.},

Several channel types can mediate dendritically initiated spikes (dSpikes), which may impact information processing and storage across multiple timescales; however, the roles of different channels in the rapid vs long-term effects of dSpikes are unknown. We show here that dSpikes mediated by Nav channels (blocked by a low concentration of TTX) are required for long-term potentiation (LTP) in the distal apical dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, imaging, simulations, and buffering experiments all support a model whereby fast Nav channel-mediated dSpikes (Na-dSpikes) contribute to LTP induction by promoting large, transient, localized increases in intracellular calcium concentration near the calcium-conducting pores of NMDAR and L-type Cav channels. Thus, in addition to contributing to rapid neural processing, Na-dSpikes are likely to contribute to memory formation via their role in long-lasting synaptic plasticity.},

  abstract        = {Kainic acid-induced status epilepticus (KA-SE) in mature rats results in the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures and a pattern of cell death resembling hippocampal sclerosis in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. In contrast, KA-SE in young animals before postnatal day (P) 18 is less likely to cause cell death or epilepsy. To investigate whether changes in neuronal excitability occur in the subiculum after KA-SE, we examined the age-dependent effects of SE on the bursting neurons of subiculum, the major output region of the hippocampus. Patch-clamp recordings were used to monitor bursting in pyramidal neurons in the subiculum of rat hippocampal slices. Neurons were studied either one or 2-3 weeks following injection of KA or saline (control) in immature (P15) or more mature (P30) rats, which differ in their sensitivity to KA as well as the long-term sequelae of the KA-SE. A significantly greater proportion of subicular pyramidal neurons from P15 rats were strong-bursting neurons and showed increased frequency-dependent bursting compared to P30 animals. Frequency-dependent burst firing was enhanced in P30, but not in P15 rats following KA-SE. The enhancement of bursting induced by KA-SE in more mature rats suggests that the frequency-dependent limitation of repetitive burst firing, which normally occurs in the subiculum, is compromised following SE. These changes could facilitate the initiation of spontaneous recurrent seizures or their spread from the hippocampus to other parts of the brain.},

Here we report that these mechanisms can coexist, through an elegant combination of distance-dependent regulation of synapse number and synaptic expression of AMPA and NMDA receptors. Together, these complementary gradients allow individual dendrites in both the apical and basal dendritic trees of hippocampal neurons to operate as facile computational subunits capable of supporting both global integration in the soma/axon and local integration in the dendrite.},

  abstract        = {We recently described a new form of neural integration and firing in a subset of interneurons, in which evoking hundreds of action potentials over tens of seconds to minutes produces a sudden barrage of action potentials lasting about a minute beyond the inciting stimulation. During this persistent firing, action potentials are generated in the distal axon and propagate retrogradely to the soma. To distinguish this from other forms of persistent firing, we refer to it here as 'retroaxonal barrage firing', or 'barrage firing' for short. Its induction is blocked by chemical inhibitors of gap junctions and curiously, stimulation of one interneuron in some cases triggers barrage firing in a nearby, unstimulated interneuron. Beyond these clues, the mechanisms of barrage firing are unknown. Here we report new results related to these mechanisms. Induction of barrage firing was blocked by lowering extracellular calcium, as long as normal action potential threshold was maintained, and it was inhibited by blocking L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Despite its calcium dependence, barrage firing was not prevented by inhibiting chemical synaptic transmission. Furthermore, loading the stimulated/recorded interneuron with BAPTA did not block barrage firing, suggesting that the required calcium entry occurs in other cells. Finally, barrage firing was normal in mice with deletion of the primary gene for neuronal gap junctions (connexin36), suggesting that non-neuronal gap junctions may be involved. Together, these findings suggest that barrage firing is probably triggered by a multicellular mechanism involving calcium signalling and gap junctions, but operating independently of chemical synaptic transmission.},

  abstract        = {Dendritic spines are the nearly ubiquitous site of excitatory synaptic input onto neurons and as such are critically positioned to influence diverse aspects of neuronal signalling. Decades of theoretical studies have proposed that spines may function as highly effective and modifiable chemical and electrical compartments that regulate synaptic efficacy, integration and plasticity. Experimental studies have confirmed activity-dependent structural dynamics and biochemical compartmentalization by spines. However, there is a longstanding debate over the influence of spines on the electrical aspects of synaptic transmission and dendritic operation. Here we measure the amplitude ratio of spine head to parent dendrite voltage across a range of dendritic compartments and calculate the associated spine neck resistance (R(neck)) for spines at apical trunk dendrites in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. We find that R(neck) is large enough (~500 MΩ) to amplify substantially the spine head depolarization associated with a unitary synaptic input by ~1.5- to ~45-fold, depending on parent dendritic impedance. A morphologically realistic compartmental model capable of reproducing the observed spatial profile of the amplitude ratio indicates that spines provide a consistently high-impedance input structure throughout the dendritic arborization. Finally, we demonstrate that the amplification produced by spines encourages electrical interaction among coactive inputs through an R(neck)-dependent increase in spine head voltage-gated conductance activation. We conclude that the electrical properties of spines promote nonlinear dendritic processing and associated forms of plasticity and storage, thus fundamentally enhancing the computational capabilities of neurons.},

Do these cells constitute a single class or are there multiple cell types with specialized functions? Using unbiased cluster analysis, we show that there are two morphologically and electrophysiologically distinct principal cell types that carry hippocampal output. We show further that these two cell types are inversely modulated by the synergistic action of glutamate and acetylcholine acting on metabotropic receptors that are central to hippocampal function. Combined with prior connectivity studies, our results support a model of hippocampal processing in which the two pyramidal cell types are predominantly segregated into two parallel pathways that process distinct modalities of information.},

Unique responses to combinations of neurotransmitters provide a powerful mechanism by which neural networks could be differentially activated during a broad range of behaviors. Here, we show, using whole-cell recordings in rat hippocampal slices, that group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) synergistically increase the excitability of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons by converting the post-burst afterhyperpolarization to an afterdepolarization via a rapidly reversible upregulation of Ca(v)2.3 R-type calcium channels. Coactivation of mAChRs and mGluRs also induced a long-lasting enhancement of the responses mediated by each receptor type. These results suggest that cooperative signaling via mAChRs and group I mGluRs could provide a mechanism by which cognitive processes may be modulated by conjoint activation of two separate neurotransmitter systems.},

  abstract        = {Pyramidal neurons in the subiculum project to a variety of cortical and subcortical areas in the brain to convey information processed in the hippocampus. Previous studies have shown that two groups of subicular pyramidal neurons--regular-spiking and bursting neurons--are distributed in an organized fashion along the proximal-distal axis, with more regular-spiking neurons close to CA1 (proximal) and more bursting neurons close to presubiculum (distal). Anatomically, neurons projecting to some targets are located more proximally along this axis, while others are located more distally. However, the relationship between the firing properties and the targets of subicular pyramidal neurons is not known. To study this relationship, we used in vivo injections of retrogradely transported fluorescent beads into each of nine different regions and conducted whole-cell current-clamp recordings from the bead-containing subicular neurons in acute brain slices. We found that subicular projections to each area were composed of a mixture of regular-spiking and bursting neurons. Neurons projecting to amygdala, lateral entorhinal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and medial/ventral orbitofrontal cortex were located primarily in the proximal subiculum and consisted mostly of regular-spiking neurons (∼80%). By contrast, neurons projecting to medial EC, presubiculum, retrosplenial cortex, and ventromedial hypothalamus were located primarily in the distal subiculum and consisted mostly of bursting neurons (∼80%). Neurons projecting to a thalamic nucleus were located in the middle portion of subiculum, and their probability of bursting was close to 50%. Thus, the fraction of bursting neurons projecting to each target region was consistent with the known distribution of regular-spiking and bursting neurons along the proximal-distal axis of the subiculum. Variation in the distribution of regular-spiking and bursting neurons suggests that different types of information are conveyed from the subiculum to its various targets.},

In CA1 pyramidal neurons, activation of group I mGluRs eliminates the post-burst afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and produces an afterdepolarization (ADP) in its place. Here we show that upregulation of Ca(v)2.3 R-type calcium channels is responsible for a component of the ADP lasting several hundred milliseconds. This medium-duration ADP is rapidly and reversibly induced by activation of mGluR5 and requires activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and release of calcium from internal stores. Effects of mGluR activation on subthreshold membrane potential changes are negligible but are large following action potential firing. Furthermore, the medium ADP exhibits a biphasic activity dependence consisting of short-term facilitation and longer-term inhibition. These findings suggest that mGluRs may dramatically alter the firing of CA1 pyramidal neurons via a complex, activity-dependent modulation of Ca(v)2.3 R-type channels that are activated during spiking at physiologically relevant rates and patterns.},

We found a much slower form of integration that leads to action potential initiation in the distal axon, well beyond the initial segment. In a subset of rodent hippocampal and neocortical interneurons, hundreds of spikes, evoked over minutes, resulted in persistent firing that lasted for a similar duration. Although axonal action potential firing was required to trigger persistent firing, somatic depolarization was not. In paired recordings, persistent firing was not restricted to the stimulated neuron; it could also be produced in the unstimulated cell. Thus, these interneurons can slowly integrate spiking, share the output across a coupled network of axons and respond with persistent firing even in the absence of input to the soma or dendrites.},

  abstract     = {According to spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), the timing of the Na(+) spike relative to the EPSP determines whether LTP or LTD will occur. Here, we review our reservations about STDP. Most investigations of this process have been done under conditions in which the spike is evoked by postsynaptic current injection. Under more realistic conditions, in which the spike is evoked by the EPSP, the results do not generally support STDP. For instance, low-frequency stimulation of a group of synapses can cause LTD, not the LTP predicted by the pre-before-post sequence in STDP; this is true regardless of whether or not the EPSP is large enough to produce a Na(+) spike. With stronger or more frequent stimulation, LTP can be induced by the same pre-before-post timing, but in this case block of Na(+) spikes does not necessarily prevent LTP induction. Thus, Na(+) spikes may facilitate LTP and/or LTD under some conditions, but they are not necessary, a finding consistent with their small size relative to the EPSP in many parts of pyramidal cell dendrites. The nature of the dendritic depolarizing events that control bidirectional plasticity is of central importance to understanding neural function. There are several candidates, including backpropagating action potentials, but also dendritic Ca(2+) spikes, the AMPA receptor-mediated EPSP, and NMDA receptor-mediated EPSPs or spikes. These often appear to be more important than the Na(+) spike in providing the depolarization necessary for plasticity. We thus feel that it is premature to accept STDP-like processes as the major determinant of LTP/LTD.},

  abstract        = {Competing models have been proposed to explain how neurons integrate the thousands of inputs distributed throughout their dendritic trees. In a simple global integration model, inputs from all locations sum in the axon. In a two-stage integration model, inputs contribute directly to dendritic spikes, and outputs from multiple branches sum in the axon. These two models yield opposite predictions of how synapses at different dendritic locations should be scaled if they are to contribute equally to neuronal output. We used serial-section electron microscopy to reconstruct individual apical oblique dendritic branches of CA1 pyramidal neurons and observe a synapse distribution consistent with the two-stage integration model. Computational modeling suggests that the observed synapse distribution enhances the contribution of each dendritic branch to neuronal output.},

  abstract        = {Since their inception, computational models have become increasingly complex and useful counterparts to laboratory experiments within the field of neuroscience. Today several software programs exist to solve the underlying mathematical system of equations, but such programs typically solve these equations in all parts of a cell (or network of cells) simultaneously, regardless of whether or not all of the cell is active. This approach can be inefficient if only part of the cell is active and many simulations must be performed. We have previously developed a numerical method that provides a framework for spatial adaptivity by making the computations local to individual branches rather than entire cells (Rempe and Chopp, SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 28: 2139-2161, 2006). Once the computation is reduced to the level of branches instead of cells, spatial adaptivity is straightforward: the active regions of the cell are detected and computational effort is focused there, while saving computations in other regions of the cell that are at or near rest. Here we apply the adaptive method to four realistic neuronal simulation scenarios and demonstrate its improved efficiency over non-adaptive methods. We find that the computational cost of the method scales with the amount of activity present in the simulation, rather than the physical size of the system being simulated. For certain problems spatial adaptivity reduces the computation time by up to 80%.},

We explored the relative contribution of these sources of depolarization to LTP induction during synaptically driven action potential firing in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Pairing of a weak test input with a strong input resulted in large LTP (approximately 75% increase) when the weak and strong inputs were both located in the apical dendrites. This form of LTP did not require somatic action potentials. When the strong input was located in the basal dendrites, the resulting LTP was smaller (< or =25% increase). Pairing the test input with somatically evoked action potentials mimicked this form of LTP. Thus, back-propagating action potentials may contribute to modest LTP, but local synaptic depolarization and/or dendritic spikes mediate a stronger form of LTP that requires spatial proximity of the associated synaptic inputs.},

Subicular pyramidal neurons exhibit low-threshold burst firing driven by a spike afterdepolarization. Here we report that burst firing can be regulated by stimulation of afferent projections to subiculum. Unlike synaptic plasticity, burst plasticity did not require synaptic depolarization, activation of AMPA or NMDA receptors, or action potential firing. Rather, enhancement of burst firing required synergistic activation of group I, subtype 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR). When either of these receptors was blocked, a suppression of bursting was revealed, which in turn was blocked by antagonists of group I, subtype 5 mGluRs. These results indicate that the output of subiculum can be strongly and bidirectionally regulated by activation of glutamatergic inputs within the hippocampus and cholinergic afferents from the medial septum.},

We find that the well-defined morphological boundaries between the hippocampal subregions CA1 and subiculum do not correspond to abrupt changes in electrophysiological properties. Rather, we observed that the percentage of bursting neurons is linearly correlated with position in the proximal-distal axis across the CA1 and the subiculum, the percentages of bursting neurons being 10% near the CA1-CA2 border, 24% at the CA1-subiculum border, and higher than 50% in the distal subiculum. The distribution of bursting neurons was paralleled by a gradient in afterdepolarization (ADP) amplitude. We also tested the hypothesis that there was an association between bursting and two previously described morphologically distinct groups of pyramidal neurons (twin and single apical dendrites) in the CA1 region. We found no difference in output mode between single and twin apical dendrite morphologies, which was consistent with the observation that the two morphologies were equally distributed across the transverse axis of the CA1 region. Taken together with the known organization of connections from CA3 to CA1 and CA1 to subiculum, our results indicate that bursting neurons are most likely to be connected to regular spiking neurons and vice versa.},

We assembled our model to simulate spatial alternation, a task that requires memory of the previous path through the environment for correct selection of the current path to a reward site. The convergence of inputs from entorhinal cortex and hippocampal region CA3 onto CA1 pyramidal cells make them potentially important for integrating information about place and temporal context on the network level. Our model shows how place and temporal context information might be combined in CA1 pyramidal neurons to give rise to splitter cells, which fire selectively based on a combination of place and temporal context. The model leads to a number of experimentally testable predictions that may lead to a better understanding of the biophysical basis of information processing in the hippocampus.},

Here we show that hippocampal synapses potentiate robustly in response to strong activation by a single burst. The induction mechanism of this single-burst LTP requires activation of NMDA receptors, L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, and dendritic spikes. Thus, dendritic spikes are a critical trigger for a form of LTP that is consistent with the function of the hippocampus in episodic memory.},

Here we show immediate and gradual effects of these intracellular solutions on measurement of the AHP and basic membrane properties, and on the induction of AHP plasticity in CA1 pyramidal neurons from rat hippocampal slices. The AHP measured immediately after establishing whole-cell recordings was larger with KMeth than with KGluc. In general, the AHP in KMeth was comparable to the AHP measured in the perforated-patch configuration. However, KMeth induced time-dependent changes in the intrinsic membrane properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Specifically, input resistance progressively increased by 70% after 50 min; correspondingly, the current required to trigger an action potential and the fast afterdepolarization following action potentials gradually decreased by about 50%. Conversely, these measures were stable in KGluc. We also demonstrate that activity-dependent plasticity of the AHP occurs with physiologically relevant stimuli in KGluc. AHPs triggered with theta-burst firing every 30 s were progressively reduced, whereas AHPs elicited every 150 s were stable. Blockade of the apamin-sensitive AHP current (I(AHP)) was insufficient to block AHP plasticity, suggesting that plasticity is manifested through changes in the apamin-insensitive slow AHP current (sI(AHP)). These changes were observed in the presence of synaptic blockers, and therefore reflect changes in the intrinsic properties of the neurons. However, no AHP plasticity was observed using KMeth. In summary, these data show that KMeth produces time-dependent changes in basic membrane properties and prevents or obscures activity-dependent reduction of the AHP. In whole-cell recordings using KGluc, repetitive theta-burst firing induced AHP plasticity that mimics learning-related reduction in the AHP.},

  abstract        = {In CA1 pyramidal neurons, burst firing is correlated with hippocampally dependent behaviours and modulation of synaptic strength. One of the mechanisms underlying burst firing in these cells is the afterdepolarization (ADP) that follows each action potential. Previous work has shown that the ADP results from the interaction of several depolarizing and hyperpolarizing conductances located in the soma and the dendrites. By using patch-clamp recordings from acute rat hippocampal slices we show that D-type potassium current modulates the size of the ADP and the bursting of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Sensitivity to alpha-dendrotoxin suggests that Kv1-containing potassium channels mediate this current. Dual somato-dendritic recording, outside-out dendritic recordings, and focal application of dendrotoxin together indicate that the channels mediating this current are located in the apical dendrites. Thus, our data present evidence for a dendritic segregation of Kv1-like channels in CA1 pyramidal neurons and identify a novel action for these channels, showing that they inhibit action potential bursting by restricting the size of the ADP.},

Synaptic potentials attenuate dramatically, however, as they propagate along dendrites toward the soma. To examine whether excitatory axospinous synapses on CA1 pyramidal neurons compensate for their distance from the soma to counteract such dendritic filtering, we evaluated axospinous synapse number and receptor expression in three progressively distal regions: proximal and distal stratum radiatum (SR), and stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM). We found that the proportion of perforated synapses increases as a function of distance from the soma and that their AMPAR, but not NMDAR, expression is highest in distal SR and lowest in SLM. Computational models of pyramidal neurons derived from these results suggest that they arise from the compartment-specific use of conductance scaling in SR and dendritic spikes in SLM to minimize the influence of distance on synaptic efficacy.},

This protocol describes techniques for recording from the dendrites of neurons in brain slices under direct visual control. Although the basic technique is similar to that used for somatic patching, we describe refinements and optimizations of slice quality, microscope optics, setup stability and electrode approach that are required for maximizing the success rate for dendritic recordings. Using this approach, all configurations of the patch-clamp technique (cell-attached, inside-out, whole-cell, outside-out and perforated patch) can be achieved, even for relatively distal dendrites, and simultaneous multiple-electrode dendritic recordings are also possible. The protocol--from the beginning of slice preparation to the end of the first successful recording--can be completed in 3 h.},

Fifty per cent attenuation of steady-state somatic voltage changes occurred at a distance of 238 microm from the soma in control and 409 microm after blocking the hyperpolarization-activated (H) conductance. The morphology of three neurons was reconstructed and used to generate computer models, which were adjusted to fit the somatic and dendritic voltage responses. These models identify several factors contributing to the voltage attenuation along CA1 dendrites, including high axial cytoplasmic resistivity, low membrane resistivity, and large H conductance. In most cells the resting membrane conductances, including the H conductances, were larger in the dendrites than the soma. Simulations suggest that synaptic potentials attenuate enormously as they propagate from the dendrite to the soma, with greater than 100-fold attenuation for synapses on many small, distal dendrites. A prediction of this powerful EPSP attenuation is that distal synaptic inputs are likely only to be effective in the presence of conductance scaling, dendritic excitability, or both.},

Voltage-clamp experiments indicate that the Ni2+-sensitive current has a pharmacological and biophysical profile consistent with R-type calcium channels. These channels are available at the resting potential, are activated by the action potential, and remain open long enough to drive the ADP.

Here we present evidence that repeated amphetamine exposure results in a suppression of intrinsic neuronal excitability in the ventral subiculum, a hippocampal region that activates dopamine neurotransmission. We used patch-clamp recordings from brain slices obtained at different times after withdrawal from repeated amphetamine exposure to determine the long-term effects of amphetamine on subicular excitability. Using several postsynaptic indices of sodium channel function, our results show that excitability is decreased for days, but not weeks, after repeated amphetamine exposure. The resulting increase in action potential threshold and decrease in postsynaptic amplification of excitatory synaptic input provide the first direct evidence that psychostimulants induce plasticity of hippocampal output and suggest one mechanism by which drug withdrawal may influence limbic dopamine-dependent learning and memory.},

  abstract     = {During early development the structure and function of the cerebral cortex is critically organized by subplate neurons (SPNs), a mostly transient population of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons located below the cortical plate. At the molecular and morphological level SPNs represent a rather diverse population of cells expressing a variety of genetic markers and revealing different axonal-dendritic morphologies. Electrophysiologically SPNs are characterized by their rather mature intrinsic membrane properties and firing patterns. They are connected via electrical and chemical synapses to local and remote neurons, e.g., thalamic relay neurons forming the first thalamocortical input to the cerebral cortex. Therefore SPNs are robustly activated at pre- and perinatal stages by the sensory periphery. Although SPNs play pivotal roles in early neocortical activity, development and plasticity, they mostly disappear by programmed cell death during further maturation. On the one hand, SPNs may be selectively vulnerable to hypoxia-ischemia contributing to brain damage, on the other hand there is some evidence that enhanced survival rates or alterations in SPN distribution may contribute to the etiology of neurological or psychiatric disorders. This review aims to give a comprehensive and up-to-date overview on the many functions of SPNs during early physiological and pathophysiological development of the cerebral cortex.},

In vitro electrical recordings from these neurons have revealed a correspondingly diverse range of intrinsic firing patterns, including non-adapting, adapting and bursting types. This heterogeneity of electrical responsivity has generally been attributed to variability in the types and densities of ionic channels. We show here, using compartmental models of reconstructed cortical neurons, that an entire spectrum of firing patterns can be reproduced in a set of neurons that share a common distribution of ion channels and differ only in their dendritic geometry. The essential behaviour of the model depends on partial electrical coupling of fast active conductances localized to the soma and axon and slow active currents located throughout the dendrites, and can be reproduced in a two-compartment model. The results suggest a causal relationship for the observed correlations between dendritic structure and firing properties and emphasize the importance of active dendritic conductances in neuronal function.},

A low memory footprint can be achieved by pruning obsolete connections or reducing the precision of connection strengths after the network has been trained. Yet, these techniques are not applicable to the case when neural networks have to be trained directly on hardware due to the hard memory constraints. Deep Rewiring (DEEP R) is a training algorithm which continuously rewires the network while preserving very sparse connectivity all along the training procedure. We apply DEEP R to a deep neural network implementation on a prototype chip of the 2nd generation SpiNNaker system. The local memory of a single core on this chip is limited to 64 KB and a deep network architecture is trained entirely within this constraint without the use of external memory. Throughout training, the proportion of active connections is limited to 1.3%. On the handwritten digits dataset MNIST, this extremely sparse network achieves 96.6% classification accuracy at convergence. Utilizing the multi-processor feature of the SpiNNaker system, we found very good scaling in terms of computation time, per-core memory consumption, and energy constraints. When compared to a X86 CPU implementation, neural network training on the SpiNNaker 2 prototype improves power and energy consumption by two orders of magnitude.},

  abstract        = {Synaptic connections between neurons in the brain are dynamic because of continuously ongoing spine dynamics, axonal sprouting, and other processes. In fact, it was recently shown that the spontaneous synapse-autonomous component of spine dynamics is at least as large as the component that depends on the history of pre- and postsynaptic neural activity. These data are inconsistent with common models for network plasticity and raise the following questions: how can neural circuits maintain a stable computational function in spite of these continuously ongoing processes, and what could be functional uses of these ongoing processes? Here, we present a rigorous theoretical framework for these seemingly stochastic spine dynamics and rewiring processes in the context of reward-based learning tasks. We show that spontaneous synapse-autonomous processes, in combination with reward signals such as dopamine, can explain the capability of networks of neurons in the brain to configure themselves for specific computational tasks, and to compensate automatically for later changes in the network or task. Furthermore, we show theoretically and through computer simulations that stable computational performance is compatible with continuously ongoing synapse-autonomous changes. After reaching good computational performance it causes primarily a slow drift of network architecture and dynamics in task-irrelevant dimensions, as observed for neural activity in motor cortex and other areas. On the more abstract level of reinforcement learning the resulting model gives rise to an understanding of reward-driven network plasticity as continuous sampling of network configurations.},

Hence, one strategy for throwing light on the computational function of cortical microcircuits is to analyze emergent computational properties of these stereotypical microcircuit motifs. We are addressing here the question how spike timing-dependent plasticity shapes the computational properties of one motif that has frequently been studied experimentally: interconnected populations of pyramidal cells and parvalbumin-positive inhibitory cells in layer 2/3. Experimental studies suggest that these inhibitory neurons exert some form of divisive inhibition on the pyramidal cells. We show that this data-based form of feedback inhibition, which is softer than that of winner-take-all models that are commonly considered in theoretical analyses, contributes to the emergence of an important computational function through spike timing-dependent plasticity: The capability to disentangle superimposed firing patterns in upstream networks, and to represent their information content through a sparse assembly code.  We analyze emergent computational properties of a ubiquitous cortical microcircuit motif: populations of pyramidal cells that are densely interconnected with inhibitory neurons. Simulations of this model predict that sparse assembly codes emerge in this microcircuit motif under spike timing-dependent plasticity. Furthermore, we show that different assemblies will represent different hidden sources of upstream firing activity. Hence, we propose that spike timing-dependent plasticity enables this microcircuit motif to perform a fundamental computational operation on neural activity patterns.},

We propose here a model that can also explain how such neural network could acquire the necessary information for that from examples. We show that spike-timing-dependent plasticity in combination with intrinsic plasticity generates in ensembles of pyramidal cells with lateral inhibition a fundamental building block for that: probabilistic associations between neurons that represent through their firing current values of random variables. Furthermore, by combining such adaptive network motifs in a recursive manner the resulting network is enabled to extract statistical information from complex input streams, and to build an internal model for the distribution p (*) that generates the examples it receives. This holds even if p (*) contains higher-order moments. The analysis of this learning process is supported by a rigorous theoretical foundation. Furthermore, we show that the network can use the learnt internal model immediately for prediction, decision making, and other types of probabilistic inference.},

Such spike-based computations promise to be substantially more power-efficient than traditional clocked processing schemes. However, it turns out to be surprisingly difficult to design networks of spiking neurons that can solve difficult computational problems on the level of single spikes, rather than rates of spikes. We present here a new method for designing networks of spiking neurons via an energy function. Furthermore, we show how the energy function of a network of stochastically firing neurons can be shaped in a transparent manner by composing the networks of simple stereotypical network motifs. We show that this design approach enables networks of spiking neurons to produce approximate solutions to difficult (NP-hard) constraint satisfaction problems from the domains of planning/optimization and verification/logical inference. The resulting networks employ noise as a computational resource. Nevertheless, the timing of spikes plays an essential role in their computations. Furthermore, networks of spiking neurons carry out for the Traveling Salesman Problem a more efficient stochastic search for good solutions compared with stochastic artificial neural networks (Boltzmann machines) and Gibbs sampling.},

  abstract        = {During the last decade, Bayesian probability theory has emerged as a framework in cognitive science and neuroscience for describing perception, reasoning and learning of mammals. However, our understanding of how probabilistic computations could be organized in the brain, and how the observed connectivity structure of cortical microcircuits supports these calculations, is rudimentary at best. In this study, we investigate statistical inference and self-organized learning in a spatially extended spiking network model, that accommodates both local competitive and large-scale associative aspects of neural information processing, under a unified Bayesian account. Specifically, we show how the spiking dynamics of a recurrent network with lateral excitation and local inhibition in response to distributed spiking input, can be understood as sampling from a variational posterior distribution of a well-defined implicit probabilistic model. This interpretation further permits a rigorous analytical treatment of experience-dependent plasticity on the network level. Using machine learning theory, we derive update rules for neuron and synapse parameters which equate with Hebbian synaptic and homeostatic intrinsic plasticity rules in a neural implementation. In computer simulations, we demonstrate that the interplay of these plasticity rules leads to the emergence of probabilistic local experts that form distributed assemblies of similarly tuned cells communicating through lateral excitatory connections. The resulting sparse distributed spike code of a well-adapted network carries compressed information on salient input features combined with prior experience on correlations among them. Our theory predicts that the emergence of such efficient representations benefits from network architectures in which the range of local inhibition matches the spatial extent of pyramidal cells that share common afferent input.},

  abstract        = {General results from statistical learning theory suggest to understand not only brain computations, but also brain plasticity as probabilistic inference. But a model for that has been missing. We propose that inherently stochastic features of synaptic plasticity and spine motility enable cortical networks of neurons to carry out probabilistic inference by sampling from a posterior distribution of network configurations. This model provides a viable alternative to existing models that propose convergence of parameters to maximum likelihood values. It explains how priors on weight distributions and connection probabilities can be merged optimally with learned experience, how cortical networks can generalize learned information so well to novel experiences, and how they can compensate continuously for unforeseen disturbances of the network. The resulting new theory of network plasticity explains from a functional perspective a number of experimental data on stochastic aspects of synaptic plasticity that previously appeared to be quite puzzling.},

Deficiencies of the existing model are its reliance on single neurons for sampling from each random variable, and the resulting limitation in representing quickly varying probabilistic information. We show that both deficiencies can be overcome by moving to a biologically more realistic encoding of each salient random variable through the stochastic firing activity of an ensemble of neurons. The resulting model demonstrates that networks of spiking neurons with noise can easily track and carry out basic computational operations on rapidly varying probability distributions, such as the odds of getting rewarded for a specific behavior. We demonstrate the viability of this new approach towards neural coding and computation, which makes use of the inherent parallelism of generic neural circuits, by showing that this model can explain experimentally observed firing activity of cortical neurons for a variety of tasks that require rapid temporal integration of sensory information.},

We show here that a generic cortical microcircuit motif, pyramidal cells with lateral excitation and inhibition, provides the basis for this difficult but all-important information processing capability. This capability emerges in the presence of noise automatically through effects of STDP on connections between pyramidal cells in Winner-Take-All circuits with lateral excitation. In fact, one can show that these motifs endow cortical microcircuits with functional properties of a hidden Markov model, a generic model for solving such tasks through probabilistic inference. Whereas in engineering applications this model is adapted to specific tasks through offline learning, we show here that a major portion of the functionality of hidden Markov models arises already from online applications of STDP, without any supervision or rewards. We demonstrate the emergent computing capabilities of the model through several computer simulations. The full power of hidden Markov model learning can be attained through reward-gated STDP. This is due to the fact that these mechanisms enable a rejection sampling approximation to theoretically optimal learning. We investigate the possible performance gain that can be achieved with this more accurate learning method for an artificial grammar task.},

Furthermore, we show that working memory can autonomously emerge through reward-modulated Hebbian learning, if needed for specific tasks. Altogether, our results suggest that reward-modulated synaptic plasticity can not only optimize the network parameters for specific computational tasks, but also initiate a functional rewiring that re-programs microcircuits, thereby generating diverse computational functions in different generic cortical microcircuits. On a more general level, this work provides a new perspective for a standard model for computations in generic cortical microcircuits (liquid computing model). It shows that the arguably most problematic assumption of this model, the postulate of a teacher that trains neural readouts through supervised learning, can be eliminated. We show that generic networks of neurons can learn numerous biologically relevant computations through trial and error.},

It is known that a theoretically optimal likelihood decoding could be carried out by simple linear readout neurons if weights of synaptic connections were set to certain values that depend on the tuning functions of sensory neurons. We show here that such theoretically optimal readout weights emerge autonomously through STDP in conjunction with lateral inhibition between readout neurons. In particular, we identify a class of optimal STDP learning rules with homeostatic plasticity, for which the autonomous emergence of optimal readouts can be explained on the basis of a rigorous learning theory. This theory shows that the network motif we consider approximates expectation-maximization for creating internal generative models for hidden causes of high-dimensional spike inputs. Notably, we find that this optimal functionality can be well approximated by a variety of STDP rules beyond those predicted by theory. Furthermore, we show that this learning process is very stable and automatically adjusts weights to changes in the number of readout neurons, the tuning functions of sensory neurons, and the statistics of external stimuli.},

Preceding work has shown that soft winner-take-all (WTA) circuits, where pyramidal neurons inhibit each other via interneurons, are a common motif of cortical microcircuits. We show through theoretical analysis and computer simulations that Bayesian computation is induced in these network motifs through STDP in combination with activity-dependent changes in the excitability of neurons. The fundamental components of this emergent Bayesian computation are priors that result from adaptation of neuronal excitability and implicit generative models for hidden causes that are created in the synaptic weights through STDP. In fact, a surprising result is that STDP is able to approximate a powerful principle for fitting such implicit generative models to high-dimensional spike inputs: Expectation Maximization. Our results suggest that the experimentally observed spontaneous activity and trial-to-trial variability of cortical neurons are essential features of their information processing capability, since their functional role is to represent probability distributions rather than static neural codes. Furthermore it suggests networks of Bayesian computation modules as a new model for distributed information processing in the cortex.},

We provide a theoretical foundation for this hypothesis by showing that even very detailed models for cortical microcircuits, with data-based diverse nonlinear neurons and synapses, have a stationary distribution of network states and trajectories of network states to which they converge exponentially fast from any initial state. We demonstrate that this convergence holds in spite of the non-reversibility of the stochastic dynamics of cortical microcircuits. We further show that, in the presence of background network oscillations, separate stationary distributions emerge for different phases of the oscillation, in accordance with experimentally reported phase-specific codes. We complement these theoretical results by computer simulations that investigate resulting computation times for typical probabilistic inference tasks on these internally stored distributions, such as marginalization or marginal maximum-a-posteriori estimation. Furthermore, we show that the inherent stochastic dynamics of generic cortical microcircuits enables them to quickly generate approximate solutions to difficult constraint satisfaction problems, where stored knowledge and current inputs jointly constrain possible solutions. This provides a powerful new computing paradigm for networks of spiking neurons, that also throws new light on how networks of neurons in the brain could carry out complex computational tasks such as prediction, imagination, memory recall and problem solving.},

We propose an alternative MP representation based on probabilistic inference in learned graphical models with new and interesting properties that complies with salient features of biological movement control. Instead of endowing the primitives with dynamical systems, we propose to endow MPs with an intrinsic probabilistic planning system, integrating the power of stochastic optimal control (SOC) methods within a MP. The parameterization of the primitive is a graphical model that represents the dynamics and intrinsic cost function such that inference in this graphical model yields the control policy. We parameterize the intrinsic cost function using task-relevant features, such as the importance of passing through certain via-points. The system dynamics as well as intrinsic cost function parameters are learned in a reinforcement learning (RL) setting. We evaluate our approach on a complex 4-link balancing task. Our experiments show that our movement representation facilitates learning significantly and leads to better generalization to new task settings without re-learning.},

It has previously been proposed that complex nonlinear features of a robot, similarly as in biological organisms, might possibly facilitate its control. This bold hypothesis, commonly referred to as morphological computation, has recently received some theoretical support by Hauser et al. (Biol Cybern 105:355-370, doi:                   10.1007/s00422-012-0471-0                                    , 2012). We show in this article that this theoretical support can be extended to cover not only the case of fading memory responses to external signals, but also the essential case of autonomous generation of adaptive periodic patterns, as, e.g., needed for locomotion. The theory predicts that feedback into the morphological computing system is necessary and sufficient for such tasks, for which a fading memory is insufficient. We demonstrate the viability of this theoretical analysis through computer simulations of complex nonlinear mass-spring systems that are trained to generate a large diversity of periodic movements by adapting the weights of a simple linear feedback device. Hence, the results of this article substantially enlarge the theoretically tractable application domain of morphological computation in robotics, and also provide new paradigms for understanding control principles of biological organisms.},

  abstract        = {To process the rich temporal structure of their acoustic environment, organisms have to integrate information over time into an appropriate neural response. Previous studies have addressed the modulation of responses of auditory neurons to a current sound in dependence of the immediate stimulation history, but a quantitative analysis of this important computational process has been missing. In this study, we analyzed temporal integration of information in the spike output of 122 single neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) of four awake ferrets in response to random tone sequences. We quantified the information contained in the responses about both current and preceding sounds in two ways: by estimating directly the mutual information between stimulus and response, and by training linear classifiers to decode information about the stimulus from the neural response. We found that 1) many neurons conveyed a significant amount of information not only about the current tone but also simultaneously about the previous tone, 2) the neural response to tone sequences was a nonlinear combination of responses to the tones in isolation, and 3) nevertheless, much of the information about current and previous tones could be extracted by linear decoders. Furthermore, our analysis of these experimental data shows that methods from information theory and the application of standard machine learning methods for extracting specific information yield quite similar results.},

In some cases an algorithm will find a natural distribution via use of map functions to process vectorized components, followed by a reduce of aggregate intermediate results. However, for some data analysis procedures such as sequence analysis, a more fundamental reformulation may be required. In this report we describe a solution to sequence comparison that can be thoroughly decomposed into multiple rounds of map and reduce operations. The route taken makes use of iterated maps, a fractal analysis technique, that has been found to provide a "alignment-free" solution to sequence analysis and comparison. That is, a solution that does not require dynamic programming, relying on a numeric Chaos Game Representation (CGR) data structure. This claim is demonstrated in this report by calculating the length of the longest similar segment by inspecting only the USM coordinates of two analogous units: with no resort to dynamic programming. The procedure described is an attempt at extreme decomposition and parallelization of sequence alignment in anticipation of a volume of genomic sequence data that cannot be met by current algorithmic frameworks. The solution found is delivered with a browser-based application (webApp), highlighting the browser's emergence as an environment for high performance distributed computing.

  abstract        = {The task of an organism to extract information about the external environment from sensory signals is based entirely on the analysis of ongoing afferent spike activity provided by the sense organs. We investigate the processing of auditory stimuli by an acoustic interneuron of insects. In contrast to most previous work we do this by using stimuli and neurophysiological recordings directly in the nocturnal tropical rainforest, where the insect communicates. Different from typical recordings in sound proof laboratories, strong environmental noise from multiple sound sources interferes with the perception of acoustic signals in these realistic scenarios. We apply a recently developed unsupervised machine learning algorithm based on probabilistic inference to find frequently occurring firing patterns in the response of the acoustic interneuron. We can thus ask how much information the central nervous system of the receiver can extract from bursts without ever being told which type and which variants of bursts are characteristic for particular stimuli. Our results show that the reliability of burst coding in the time domain is so high that identical stimuli lead to extremely similar spike pattern responses, even for different preparations on different dates, and even if one of the preparations is recorded outdoors and the other one in the sound proof lab. Simultaneous recordings in two preparations exposed to the same acoustic environment reveal that characteristics of burst patterns are largely preserved among individuals of the same species. Our study shows that burst coding can provide a reliable mechanism for acoustic insects to classify and discriminate signals under very noisy real-world conditions. This gives new insights into the neural mechanisms potentially used by bushcrickets to discriminate conspecific songs from sounds of predators in similar carrier frequency bands.},

Non-rigid body parts are not seen anymore as imperfect realizations of rigid body parts, but rather as potential computational resources. The applicability of this vision has already been demonstrated for a variety of complex robot control problems. Nevertheless, a theoretical basis for understanding the capabilities and limitations of morphological computation has been missing so far. We present a model for morphological computation with compliant bodies, where a precise mathematical characterization oft he potential computational contribution of a complex physical body is feasible. The theory suggests that complexity and nonlinearity, typically unwanted properties of robots, are desired features in order to provide computational power. We demonstrate that simple generic models of physical bodies,based on mass-spring systems, can be used to implement complex nonlinear operators. By adding a simple readout(which is static and linear) to the morphology, such devices are able to emulate complex mappings of input to output streams in continuous time. Hence, by outsourcing parts of the computation to the physical body, the difficult problem of learning to control a complex body, could be reduced to a simple and perspicuous learning task, which can not get stuck in local minima of an error function.},

In particular, it enables them to carry out probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks with converging arrows ("explaining away") and with undirected loops, that occur in many real-world tasks. Ubiquitous stochastic features of networks of spiking neurons, such as trial-to-trial variability and spontaneous activity, are necessary ingredients of the underlying computational organization. We demonstrate through computer simulations that this approach can be scaled up to neural emulations of probabilistic inference in fairly large graphical models, yielding some of the most complex computations that have been carried out so far in networks of spiking neurons.},

However, it is not clear how single neurons could acquire such functionality in a self-organized manner, because most theoretical studies of synaptic plasticity and learning concentrate on neuron models without nonlinear dendritic properties. In the meantime, a complex picture of information processing with dendritic spikes and a variety of plasticity mechanisms in single neurons has emerged from experiments. In particular, new experimental data on dendritic branch strength potentiation in rat hippocampus have not yet been incorporated into such models. In this article, we investigate how experimentally observed plasticity mechanisms, such as depolarization-dependent spike-timing-dependent plasticity and branch-strength potentiation, could be integrated to self-organize nonlinear neural computations with dendritic spikes. We provide a mathematical proof that, in a simplified setup, these plasticity mechanisms induce a competition between dendritic branches, a novel concept in the analysis of single neuron adaptivity. We show via computer simulations that such dendritic competition enables a single neuron to become member of several neuronal ensembles and to acquire nonlinear computational capabilities, such as the capability to bind multiple input features. Hence, our results suggest that nonlinear neural computation may self-organize in single neurons through the interaction of local synaptic and dendritic plasticity mechanisms.},

In principle there exists a powerful computational framework for stochastic computations, probabilistic inference by sampling, which can explain a large number of macroscopic experimental data in neuroscience and cognitive science. But it has turned out to be surprisingly difficult to create a link between these abstract models for stochastic computations and more detailed models of the dynamics of networks of spiking neurons. Here we create such a link and show that under some conditions the stochastic firing activity of networks of spiking neurons can be interpreted as probabilistic inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Since common methods for MCMC sampling in distributed systems, such as Gibbs sampling, are inconsistent with the dynamics of spiking neurons, we introduce a different approach based on non-reversible Markov chains that is able to reflect inherent temporal processes of spiking neuronal activity through a suitable choice of random variables. We propose a neural network model and show by a rigorous theoretical analysis that its neural activity implements MCMC sampling of a given distribution, both for the case of discrete and continuous time. This provides a step towards closing the gap between abstract functional models of cortical computation and more detailed models of networks of spiking neurons.},

The difficulty of this problem is a consequence of the high dimensionality of the action space of a humanoid robot, due to its large number of degrees of freedom (joints), and of non-linearities in its kinematic chains. Biped biological organisms face similar difficulties, but have nevertheless solved this problem. Experimental data reveal that many biological organisms reduce the high dimensionality of their action space by generating movements through linear superposition of a rather small number of stereotypical combinations of simultaneous movements of many joints, to which we refer as kinematic synergies in this paper. We show that by constructing two suitable non-linear kinematic synergies for the lower part of the body of a humanoid robot, balance control can in fact be reduced to a linear control problem, at least in the case of relatively slow movements. We demonstrate for a variety of tasks that the humanoid robot HOAP-2 acquires through this approach the capability to balance dynamically against unforeseen disturbances that may arise from external forces or from manipulating unknown loads.},

Knowledge organization systems (KOSs) can provide an abstraction for publishing biological discoveries as Linked Data without complicating transactions with contextual minutia such as provenance and access control.We have previously described the Simple Sloppy Semantic Database (S3DB) as an efficient model for creating knowledge organization systems using Linked Data best practices with explicit distinction between domain and instantiation and support for a permission control mechanism that automatically migrates between the two. In this report we present a domain specific language, the S3DB query language (S3QL), to operate on its underlying core model and facilitate management of Linked Data. Reflecting the data driven nature of our approach, S3QL has been implemented as an application programming interface for S3DB systems hosting biomedical data, and its syntax was subsequently generalized beyond the S3DB core model. This achievement is illustrated with the assembly of an S3QL query to manage entities from the Simple Knowledge Organization System. The illustrative use cases include gastrointestinal clinical trials, genomic characterization of cancer by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and molecular epidemiology of infectious diseases. S3QL was found to provide a convenient mechanism to represent context for interoperation between public and private datasets hosted at biomedical research institutions and linked data formalisms.},

It is seldom considered whether the simulated spiking activity is realistic (in a statistical sense) in response to natural stimuli. Because certain statistical properties of spike responses were suggested to facilitate computations in the cortex, acquiring a realistic firing regimen in cortical network models might be a prerequisite for analyzing their computational functions. We present a characterization and comparison of the statistical response properties of the primary visual cortex (V1) in vivo and in silico in response to natural stimuli. We recorded from multiple electrodes in area V1 of 4 macaque monkeys and developed a large state-of-the-art network model for a 5 × 5-mm patch of V1 composed of 35,000 neurons and 3.9 million synapses that integrates previously published anatomical and physiological details. By quantitative comparison of the model response to the "statistical fingerprint" of responses in vivo, we find that our model for a patch of V1 responds to the same movie in a way which matches the statistical structure of the recorded data surprisingly well. The deviation between the firing regimen of the model and the in vivo data are on the same level as deviations among monkeys and sessions. This suggests that, despite strong simplifications and abstractions of cortical network models, they are nevertheless capable of generating realistic spiking activity. To reach a realistic firing state, it was not only necessary to include both N-methyl-d-aspartate and GABA(B) synaptic conductances in our model, but also to markedly increase the strength of excitatory synapses onto inhibitory neurons (>2-fold) in comparison to literature values, hinting at the importance to carefully adjust the effect of inhibition for achieving realistic dynamics in current network models.},

  abstract        = {Neurons in the brain are able to detect and discriminate salient spatiotemporal patterns in the firing activity of presynaptic neurons. It is open how they can learn to achieve this, especially without the help of a supervisor. We show that a well-known unsupervised learning algorithm for linear neurons, slow feature analysis (SFA), is able to acquire the discrimination capability of one of the best algorithms for supervised linear discrimination learning, the Fisher linear discriminant (FLD), given suitable input statistics. We demonstrate the power of this principle by showing that it enables readout neurons from simulated cortical microcircuits to learn without any supervision to discriminate between spoken digits and to detect repeated firing patterns that are embedded into a stream of noise spike trains with the same firing statistics. Both these computer simulations and our theoretical analysis show that slow feature extraction enables neurons to extract and collect information that is spread out over a trajectory of firing states that lasts several hundred ms. In addition, it enables neurons to learn without supervision to keep track of time (relative to a stimulus onset, or the initiation of a motor response). Hence, these results elucidate how the brain could compute with trajectories of firing states rather than only with fixed point attractors. It also provides a theoretical basis for understanding recent experimental results on the emergence of view- and position-invariant classification of visual objects in inferior temporal cortex.},

However, beyond well defined research initiatives, substantial issues of data heterogeneity, source distribution, and privacy currently stand in the way towards the personalization of Medicine. A computational framework for bioinformatic infrastructure was designed to deal with the heterogeneous data sources and the sensitive mixture of public and private data that characterizes the biomedical domain. This framework consists of a logical model build with semantic web tools, coupled with a Markov process that propagates user operator states. An accompanying open source prototype was developed to meet a series of applications that range from collaborative multi-institution data acquisition efforts to data analysis applications that need to quickly traverse complex data structures. This report describes the two abstractions underlying the S3DB-based infrastructure, logical and numerical, and discusses its generality beyond the immediate confines of existing implementations. The emergence of the "web as a computer" requires a formal model for the different functionalities involved in reading and writing to it. The S3DB core model proposed was found to address the design criteria of biomedical computational infrastructure, such as those supporting large scale multi-investigator research, clinical trials, and molecular epidemiology.},

In particular, it was shown that the three-dimensional tuning curves of neurons whose decoding parameters were reassigned changed more than those of neurons whose decoding parameters had not been reassigned. In this article, we propose a simple learning rule that can reproduce this effect. Our learning rule uses Hebbian weight updates driven by a global reward signal and neuronal noise. In contrast to most previously proposed learning rules, this approach does not require extrinsic information to separate noise from signal. The learning rule is able to optimize the performance of a model system within biologically realistic periods of time under high noise levels. Furthermore, when the model parameters are matched to data recorded during the brain-computer interface learning experiments described above, the model produces learning effects strikingly similar to those found in the experiments.},

Still, like all analog hardware systems, neuromorphic models suffer from a constricted configurability and production-related fluctuations of device characteristics. Since also future systems, involving ever-smaller structures, will inevitably exhibit such inhomogeneities on the unit level, self-regulation properties become a crucial requirement for their successful operation. By applying a cortically inspired self-adjusting network architecture, we show that the activity of generic spiking neural networks emulated on a neuromorphic hardware system can be kept within a biologically realistic firing regime and gain a remarkable robustness against transistor-level variations. As a first approach of this kind in engineering practice, the short-term synaptic depression and facilitation mechanisms implemented within an analog VLSI model of I&F neurons are functionally utilized for the purpose of network level stabilization. We present experimental data acquired both from the hardware model and from comparative software simulations which prove the applicability of the employed paradigm to neuromorphic VLSI devices.},

This drastic dimensionality reduction suggests considering a neuron as a bottleneck for information transmission. Extending recent results, we propose a simple learning rule for the weights of spiking neurons derived from the information bottleneck (IB) framework that minimizes the loss of relevant information transmitted in the output spike train. In the IB framework, relevance of information is defined with respect to contextual information, the latter entering the proposed learning rule as a "third" factor besides pre- and postsynaptic activities. This renders the theoretically motivated learning rule a plausible model for experimentally observed synaptic plasticity phenomena involving three factors. Furthermore, we show that the proposed IB learning rule allows spiking neurons to learn a predictive code, that is, to extract those parts of their input that are predictive for future input.},

We cast our Bayesian-Hebb learning rule as reinforcement learning in which certain decisions are rewarded and prove that each synaptic weight will on average converge exponentially fast to the log-odd of receiving a reward when its pre- and postsynaptic neurons are active. In our simple architecture, a particular action is selected from the set of candidate actions by a winner-take-all operation. The global reward assigned to this action then modulates the update of each synapse. Apart from this global reward signal, our reward-modulated Bayesian Hebb rule is a pure Hebb update that depends only on the coactivation of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons, not on the weighted sum of all presynaptic inputs to the postsynaptic neuron as in the perceptron learning rule or the Rescorla-Wagner rule. This simple approach to action-selection learning requires that information about sensory inputs be presented to the Bayesian decision stage in a suitably preprocessed form resulting from other adaptive processes (acting on a larger timescale) that detect salient dependencies among input features. Hence our proposed framework for fast learning of decisions also provides interesting new hypotheses regarding neural nodes and computational goals of cortical areas that provide input to the final decision stage.},

We made multielectrode recordings from cat primary visual cortex and applied methods from machine learning in order to analyze the temporal evolution of stimulus-related information in the spiking activity of large ensembles of around 100 neurons. We used sequences of up to three different visual stimuli (letters of the alphabet) presented for 100 ms and with intervals of 100 ms or larger. Most of the information about visual stimuli extractable by sophisticated methods of machine learning, i.e., support vector machines with nonlinear kernel functions, was also extractable by simple linear classification such as can be achieved by individual neurons. New stimuli did not erase information about previous stimuli. The responses to the most recent stimulus contained about equal amounts of information about both this and the preceding stimulus. This information was encoded both in the discharge rates (response amplitudes) of the ensemble of neurons and, when using short time constants for integration (e.g., 20 ms), in the precise timing of individual spikes (<or= approximately 20 ms), and persisted for several 100 ms beyond the offset of stimuli. The results indicate that the network from which we recorded is endowed with fading memory and is capable of performing online computations utilizing information about temporally sequential stimuli. This result challenges models assuming frame-by-frame analyses of sequential inputs.},

However, it is unclear how to implement these inferential processes in neuronal networks. We offer a solution to this problem by showing in detailed simulations how the belief propagation algorithm on a factor graph can be embedded in a network of spiking neurons. We use pools of spiking neurons as the function nodes of the factor graph. Each pool gathers "messages" in the form of population activities from its input nodes and combines them through its network dynamics. Each of the various output messages to be transmitted over the edges of the graph is computed by a group of readout neurons that feed in their respective destination pools. We use this approach to implement two examples of factor graphs. The first example, drawn from coding theory, models the transmission of signals through an unreliable channel and demonstrates the principles and generality of our network approach. The second, more applied example is of a psychophysical mechanism in which visual cues are used to resolve hypotheses about the interpretation of an object's shape and illumination. These two examples, and also a statistical analysis, demonstrate good agreement between the performance of our networks and the direct numerical evaluation of belief propagation.},

This method would allow extracting preferentially those components from high-dimensional sensory input streams that are related to other information sources, such as internal predictions or proprioceptive feedback. However, there exists a lack of models that could explain how spiking neurons could learn to execute either of these two processing strategies. We show in this article how stochastically spiking neurons with refractoriness could in principle learn in an unsupervised manner to carry out both information bottleneck optimization and the extraction of independent components. We derive suitable learning rules, which extend the well-known BCM rule, from abstract information optimization principles. These rules will simultaneously keep the firing rate of the neuron within a biologically realistic range.},

  abstract        = {The neocortex is a continuous sheet composed of rather stereotypical local microcircuits that consist of neurons on several laminae with characteristic synaptic connectivity patterns. An understanding of the structure and computational function of these cortical microcircuits may hold the key for understanding the enormous computational power of the neocortex. Two templates for the structure of laminar cortical microcircuits have recently been published by Thomson et al. and Binzegger et al., both resulting from long-lasting experimental studies (but based on different methods). We analyze and compare in this article the structure of these two microcircuit templates. In particular, we examine the distribution of network motifs, i.e. of subcircuits consisting of a small number of neurons. The distribution of these building blocks has recently emerged as a method for characterizing similarities and differences among complex networks. We show that the two microcircuit templates have quite different distributions of network motifs, although they both have a characteristic small-world property. In order to understand the dynamical and computational properties of these two microcircuit templates, we have generated computer models of them, consisting of Hodgkin-Huxley point neurons with conductance based synapses that have a biologically realistic short-term plasticity. The performance of these two cortical microcircuit models was studied for seven generic computational tasks that require accumulation and merging of information contained in two afferent spike inputs. Although the two models exhibit a different performance for some of these tasks, their average computational performance is very similar. When we changed the connectivity structure of these two microcircuit models in order to see which aspects of it are essential for computational performance, we found that the distribution of degrees of nodes is a common key factor for their computational performance. We also show that their computational performance is correlated with specific statistical properties of the circuit dynamics that is induced by a particular distribution of degrees of nodes.},

  abstract     = {The control of neuroprosthetic devices from the activity of motor cortex neurons benefits from learning effects where the function of these neurons is adapted to the control task. It was recently shown that tuning properties of neurons in monkey motor cortex are adapted selectively in order to compensate for an erroneous interpretation of their activity. In particular, it was shown that the tuning curves of those neurons whose preferred directions had been misinterpreted changed more than those of other neurons. In this article, we show that the experimentally observed self-tuning properties of the system can be explained on the basis of a simple learning rule. This learning rule utilizes neuronal noise for exploration and performs Hebbian weight updates that are modulated by a global reward signal. In contrast to most previously proposed reward-modulated Hebbian learning rules, this rule does not require extraneous knowledge about what is noise and what is signal. The learning rule is able to optimize the performance of the model system within biologically realistic periods of time and under high noise levels. When the neuronal noise is fitted to experimental data, the model produces learning effects similar to those found in monkey experiments.},

  abstract        = {Reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) has recently emerged as a candidate for a learning rule that could explain how behaviorally relevant adaptive changes in complex networks of spiking neurons could be achieved in a self-organizing manner through local synaptic plasticity. However, the capabilities and limitations of this learning rule could so far only be tested through computer simulations. This article provides tools for an analytic treatment of reward-modulated STDP, which allows us to predict under which conditions reward-modulated STDP will achieve a desired learning effect. These analytical results imply that neurons can learn through reward-modulated STDP to classify not only spatial but also temporal firing patterns of presynaptic neurons. They also can learn to respond to specific presynaptic firing patterns with particular spike patterns. Finally, the resulting learning theory predicts that even difficult credit-assignment problems, where it is very hard to tell which synaptic weights should be modified in order to increase the global reward for the system, can be solved in a self-organizing manner through reward-modulated STDP. This yields an explanation for a fundamental experimental result on biofeedback in monkeys by Fetz and Baker. In this experiment monkeys were rewarded for increasing the firing rate of a particular neuron in the cortex and were able to solve this extremely difficult credit assignment problem. Our model for this experiment relies on a combination of reward-modulated STDP with variable spontaneous firing activity. Hence it also provides a possible functional explanation for trial-to-trial variability, which is characteristic for cortical networks of neurons but has no analogue in currently existing artificial computing systems. In addition our model demonstrates that reward-modulated STDP can be applied to all synapses in a large recurrent neural network without endangering the stability of the network dynamics.},

Using support vector machines and linear regression models, we found that in the primary visual cortex (V1) of monkeys, spikes can indeed be inferred from LFPs, at least with moderate success. Although there is a considerable degree of variation across electrodes, the low-frequency structure in spike trains (in the 100-ms range) can be inferred with reasonable accuracy, whereas exact spike positions are not reliably predicted. Two kinds of features of the LFP are exploited for prediction: the frequency power of bands in the high gamma-range (40-90 Hz) and information contained in low-frequency oscillations (<10 Hz), where both phase and power modulations are informative. Information analysis revealed that both features code (mainly) independent aspects of the spike-to-LFP relationship, with the low-frequency LFP phase coding for temporally clustered spiking activity. Although both features and prediction quality are similar during seminatural movie stimuli and spontaneous activity, prediction performance during spontaneous activity degrades much more slowly with increasing electrode distance. The general trend of data obtained with anesthetized animals is qualitatively mirrored in that of a more limited data set recorded in V1 of non-anesthetized monkeys. In contrast to the cortical field potentials, thalamic LFPs (e.g., LFPs derived from recordings in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus) hold no useful information for predicting spiking activity.},

  abstract        = {One may argue that the simplest type of neural networks beyond a single perceptron is an array of several perceptrons in parallel. In spite of their simplicity, such circuits can compute any Boolean function if one views the majority of the binary perceptron outputs as the binary output of the parallel perceptron, and they are universal approximators for arbitrary continuous functions with values in [0,1] if one views the fraction of perceptrons that output 1 as the analog output of the parallel perceptron. Note that in contrast to the familiar model of a "multi-layer perceptron" the parallel perceptron that we consider here has just binary values as outputs of gates on the hidden layer. For a long time one has thought that there exists no competitive learning algorithm for these extremely simple neural networks, which also came to be known as committee machines. It is commonly assumed that one has to replace the hard threshold gates on the hidden layer by sigmoidal gates (or RBF-gates) and that one has to tune the weights on at least two successive layers in order to achieve satisfactory learning results for any class of neural networks that yield universal approximators. We show that this assumption is not true, by exhibiting a simple learning algorithm for parallel perceptrons - the parallel delta rule (p-delta rule). In contrast to backprop for multi-layer perceptrons, the p-delta rule only has to tune a single layer of weights, and it does not require the computation and communication of analog values with high precision. Reduced communication also distinguishes our new learning rule from other learning rules for parallel perceptrons such as MADALINE. Obviously these features make the p-delta rule attractive as a biologically more realistic alternative to backprop in biological neural circuits, but also for implementations in special purpose hardware. We show that the p-delta rule also implements gradient descent-with regard to a suitable error measure-although it does not require to compute derivatives. Furthermore it is shown through experiments on common real-world benchmark datasets that its performance is competitive with that of other learning approaches from neural networks and machine learning. It has recently been shown [Anthony, M. (2007). On the generalization error of fixed combinations of classifiers. Journal of Computer and System Sciences 73(5), 725-734; Anthony, M. (2004). On learning a function of perceptrons. In Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE international joint conference on neural networks (pp. 967-972): Vol. 2] that one can also prove quite satisfactory bounds for the generalization error of this new learning rule.},

Criteria that tell us when a perceptron can implement (or learn to implement) all possible dichotomies over a given set of input patterns are well known, but only for the idealized case, where one assumes that the sign of a synaptic weight can be switched during learning. We present in this letter an analysis of the classification capability of the biologically more realistic model of a sign-constrained perceptron, where the signs of synaptic weights remain fixed during learning (which is the case for most types of biological synapses). In particular, the VC-dimension of sign-constrained perceptrons is determined, and a necessary and sufficient criterion is provided that tells us when all 2(m) dichotomies over a given set of m patterns can be learned by a sign-constrained perceptron. We also show that uniformity of L(1) norms of input patterns is a sufficient condition for full representation power in the case where all weights are required to be nonnegative. Finally, we exhibit cases where the sign constraint of a perceptron drastically reduces its classification capability. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by computer simulations, which demonstrate in particular that sparse input patterns improve the classification capability of sign-constrained perceptrons.},

Here we show-through theoretical analysis and extensive computer simulations-that short-term synaptic plasticity endows models of cortical circuits with a remarkable stability in the low-activity regime. This short-term plasticity works as a homeostatic mechanism that stabilizes the overall activity level in spite of drastic changes in external inputs and internal circuit properties, while preserving reliable transient responses to signals.

  abstract        = {It has previously been shown that generic cortical microcircuit models can perform complex real-time computations on continuous input streams, provided that these computations can be carried out with a rapidly fading memory. We investigate the computational capability of such circuits in the more realistic case where not only readout neurons, but in addition a few neurons within the circuit, have been trained for specific tasks. This is essentially equivalent to the case where the output of trained readout neurons is fed back into the circuit. We show that this new model overcomes the limitation of a rapidly fading memory. In fact, we prove that in the idealized case without noise it can carry out any conceivable digital or analog computation on time-varying inputs. But even with noise, the resulting computational model can perform a large class of biologically relevant real-time computations that require a nonfading memory. We demonstrate these computational implications of feedback both theoretically, and through computer simulations of detailed cortical microcircuit models that are subject to noise and have complex inherent dynamics. We show that the application of simple learning procedures (such as linear regression or perceptron learning) to a few neurons enables such circuits to represent time over behaviorally relevant long time spans, to integrate evidence from incoming spike trains over longer periods of time, and to process new information contained in such spike trains in diverse ways according to the current internal state of the circuit. In particular we show that such generic cortical microcircuits with feedback provide a new model for working memory that is consistent with a large set of biological constraints. Although this article examines primarily the computational role of feedback in circuits of neurons, the mathematical principles on which its analysis is based apply to a variety of dynamical systems. Hence they may also throw new light on the computational role of feedback in other complex biological dynamical systems, such as, for example, genetic regulatory networks.},

  abstract        = {A major challenge for computational neuroscience is to understand the computational function of lamina-specific synaptic connection patterns in stereotypical cortical microcircuits. Previous work on this problem had focused on hypothesized specific computational roles of individual layers and connections between layers and had tested these hypotheses through simulations of abstract neural network models. We approach this problem by studying instead the dynamical system defined by more realistic cortical microcircuit models as a whole and by investigating the influence that its laminar structure has on the transmission and fusion of information within this dynamical system. The circuit models that we examine consist of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with dynamic synapses, based on detailed data from Thomson and others (2002), Markram and others (1998), and Gupta and others (2000). We investigate to what extent this cortical microcircuit template supports the accumulation and fusion of information contained in generic spike inputs into layer 4 and layers 2/3 and how well it makes this information accessible to projection neurons in layers 2/3 and layer 5. We exhibit specific computational advantages of such data-based lamina-specific cortical microcircuit model by comparing its performance with various types of control models that have the same components and the same global statistics of neurons and synaptic connections but are missing the lamina-specific structure of real cortical microcircuits. We conclude that computer simulations of detailed lamina-specific cortical microcircuit models provide new insight into computational consequences of anatomical and physiological data.},

  abstract        = {Circuits composed of threshold gates (McCulloch-Pitts neurons, or perceptrons) are simplified models of neural circuits with the advantage that they are theoretically more tractable than their biological counterparts. However, when such threshold circuits are designed to perform a specific computational task, they usually differ in one important respect from computations in the brain: they require very high activity. On average every second threshold gate fires (sets a 1 as output) during a computation. By contrast, the activity of neurons in the brain is much sparser, with only about 1% of neurons firing. This mismatch between threshold and neuronal circuits is due to the particular complexity measures (circuit size and circuit depth) that have been minimized in previous threshold circuit constructions. In this letter, we investigate a new complexity measure for threshold circuits, energy complexity, whose minimization yields computations with sparse activity. We prove that all computations by threshold circuits of polynomial size with entropy O(log n) can be restructured so that their energy complexity is reduced to a level near the entropy of circuit states. This entropy of circuit states is a novel circuit complexity measure, which is of interest not only in the context of threshold circuits but for circuit complexity in general. As an example of how this measure can be applied, we show that any polynomial size threshold circuit with entropy O(log n) can be simulated by a polynomial size threshold circuit of depth 3. Our results demonstrate that the structure of circuits that result from a minimization of their energy complexity is quite different from the structure that results from a minimization of previously considered complexity measures, and potentially closer to the structure of neural circuits in the nervous system. In particular, different pathways are activated in these circuits for different classes of inputs. This letter shows that such circuits with sparse activity have a surprisingly large computational power.},

A minor change in the connection statistics of such circuits (making synaptic connections to more distal target neurons more likely for excitatory than for inhibitory neurons) endows such generic neural microcircuit model with the ability to generate periodic patterns autonomously. We show that such pattern generation can also be multiplexed with pattern classification and temporal integration of information in the same neural circuit. These results can be interpreted as showing that periodic activity provides a second channel for communication in neural systems which can be used to synchronize or coordinate spatially separated processes, without encumbering local real-time computations on spike trains in diverse neural circuits.},

  abstract        = {A key challenge for neural modeling is to explain how a continuous stream of multimodal input from a rapidly changing environment can be processed by stereotypical recurrent circuits of integrate-and-fire neurons in real time. We propose a new computational model for real-time computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead, it is based on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical learning theory and can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional dynamical system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can learn to extract in real time from the current state of such recurrent neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine, that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict universal computational power under idealized conditions, but for the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing of time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for the interpretation of neural coding, the design of experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology, and the solution of problems in robotics and neurotechnology.},

  abstract        = {It is quite difficult to construct circuits of spiking neurons that can carry out complex computational tasks. On the other hand even randomly connected circuits of spiking neurons can in principle be used for complex computational tasks such as time-warp invariant speech recognition. This is possible because such circuits have an inherent tendency to integrate incoming information in such a way that simple linear readouts can be trained to transform the current circuit activity into the target output for a very large number of computational tasks. Consequently we propose to analyze circuits of spiking neurons in terms of their roles as analog fading memory and non-linear kernels, rather than as implementations of specific computational operations and algorithms. This article is a sequel to [W. Maass, T. Natschläger, H. Markram, Real-time computing without stable states: a new framework for neural computation based on perturbations, Neural Comput. 14 (11) (2002) 2531-2560, Online available as #130 from: ], and contains new results about the performance of generic neural microcircuit models for the recognition of speech that is subject to linear and non-linear time-warps, as well as for computations on time-varying firing rates. These computations rely, apart from general properties of generic neural microcircuit models, just on capabilities of simple linear readouts trained by linear regression. This article also provides detailed data on the fading memory property of generic neural microcircuit models, and a quick review of other new results on the computational power of such circuits of spiking neurons.},

  abstract     = {Real-world value often depends on subtle, continuously variable visual cues specific to particular object categories, like the tailoring of a suit, the condition of an automobile, or the construction of a house. Here, we used microelectrode recording in behaving monkeys to test two possible mechanisms for category-specific value-cue processing: (1) previous findings suggest that prefrontal cortex (PFC) identifies object categories, and based on category identity, PFC could use top-down attentional modulation to enhance visual processing of category-specific value cues, providing signals to PFC for calculating value, and (2) a faster mechanism would be first-pass visual processing of category-specific value cues, immediately providing the necessary visual information to PFC. This, however, would require learned mechanisms for processing the appropriate cues in a given object category. To test these hypotheses, we trained monkeys to discriminate value in four letter-like stimulus categories. Each category had a different, continuously variable shape cue that signified value (liquid reward amount) as well as other cues that were irrelevant. Monkeys chose between stimuli of different reward values. Consistent with the first-pass hypothesis, we found early signals for category-specific value cues in area TE (the final stage in monkey ventral visual pathway) beginning 81 ms after stimulus onset-essentially at the start of TE responses. Task-related activity emerged in lateral PFC approximately 40 ms later and consisted mainly of category-invariant value tuning. Our results show that, for familiar, behaviorally relevant object categories, high-level ventral pathway cortex can implement rapid, first-pass processing of category-specific value cues.},

The ventral, object-processing visual pathway carries precise spatial information, transformed from retinotopic coordinates into relative dimensions. At the final stages of the ventral pathway, including the dorsal anterior temporal lobe (TEd), object-sensitive neurons are intermixed with neurons that process large-scale environmental space. TEd projects primarily to perirhinal cortex (PRC), which in turn projects to lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC). PRC and LEC also combine object and spatial information. For example, PRC and LEC neurons exhibit place fields that are evoked by landmark objects or the remembered locations of objects. Thus, spatial information, on both local and global scales, is deeply integrated into the ventral (temporal) object-processing pathway in vision and memory.},

  abstract        = {The ventral visual pathway in humans and non-human primates is known to represent object information, including shape and identity [1]. Here, we show the ventral pathway also represents scene structure aligned with the gravitational reference frame in which objects move and interact. We analyzed shape tuning of recently described macaque monkey ventral pathway neurons that prefer scene-like stimuli to objects [2]. Individual neurons did not respond to a single shape class, but to a variety of scene elements that are typically aligned with gravity: large planes in the orientation range of ground surfaces under natural viewing conditions, planes in the orientation range of ceilings, and extended convex and concave edges in the orientation range of wall/floor/ceiling junctions. For a given neuron, these elements tended to share a common alignment in eye-centered coordinates. Thus, each neuron integrated information about multiple gravity-aligned structures as they would be seen from a specific eye and head orientation. This eclectic coding strategy provides only ambiguous information about individual structures but explicit information about the environmental reference frame and the orientation of gravity in egocentric coordinates. In the ventral pathway, this could support perceiving and/or predicting physical events involving objects subject to gravity, recognizing object attributes like animacy based on movement not caused by gravity, and/or stabilizing perception of the world against changes in head orientation [3-5]. Our results, like the recent discovery of object weight representation [6], imply that the ventral pathway is involved not just in recognition, but also in physical understanding of objects and scenes.},

  abstract        = {Inferotemporal cortex (IT) has long been studied as a single pathway dedicated to object vision, but connectivity analysis reveals anatomically distinct channels, through ventral superior temporal sulcus (STSv) and dorsal/ventral inferotemporal gyrus (TEd, TEv). Here, we report a major functional distinction between channels. We studied individual IT neurons in monkeys viewing stereoscopic 3D images projected on a large screen. We used adaptive stimuli to explore neural tuning for 3D abstract shapes ranging in scale and topology from small, closed, bounded objects to large, open, unbounded environments (landscape-like surfaces and cave-like interiors). In STSv, most neurons were more responsive to objects, as expected. In TEd, surprisingly, most neurons were more responsive to 3D environmental shape. Previous studies have localized environmental information to posterior cortical modules. Our results show it is also channeled through anterior IT, where extensive cross-connections between STSv and TEd could integrate object and environmental shape information.},

  abstract        = {Tactile shape information is elaborated in a cortical hierarchy spanning primary (SI) and secondary somatosensory cortex (SII). Indeed, SI neurons in areas 3b and 1 encode simple contour features such as small oriented bars and edges, whereas higher order SII neurons represent large curved contour features such as angles and arcs. However, neural coding of these contour features has not been systematically characterized in area 2, the most caudal SI subdivision in the postcentral gyrus. In the present study, we analyzed area 2 neural responses to embossed oriented bars and curved contour fragments to establish whether curvature representations are generated in the postcentral gyrus. We found that many area 2 neurons (26 of 112) exhibit clear curvature tuning, preferring contours pointing in a particular direction. Fewer area 2 neurons (15 of 112) show preferences for oriented bars. Because area 2 response patterns closely resembled SII patterns, we also compared area 2 and SII response time courses to characterize the temporal dynamics of curvature synthesis in the somatosensory system. We found that curvature representations develop and peak concurrently in area 2 and SII. These results reveal that transitions from orientation tuning to curvature selectivity in the somatosensory cortical hierarchy occur within SI rather than between SI and SII.},

We described how early PIT responses to individual contour fragments evolve into tuning for multifragment shape configurations. Here, we analyzed curvature processing dynamics in area V4, which provides feedforward inputs to PIT. We contrasted 2 hypotheses: 1) that V4 curvature tuning evolves from tuning for simpler elements, analogous to PIT shape synthesis and 2) that V4 curvature tuning emerges immediately, based on purely feedforward mechanisms. Our results clearly supported the first hypothesis. Early V4 responses carried information about individual contour orientations. Tuning for multiorientation (curved) contours developed gradually over ∼50 ms. Together, the current and previous results suggest a partial sequence for shape synthesis in ventral pathway cortex. We propose that early orientation signals are synthesized into curved contour fragment representations in V4 and that these signals are transmitted to PIT, where they are then synthesized into multifragment shape representations. The observed dynamics might additionally or alternatively reflect influences from earlier (V1, V2) and later (central and anterior IT) processing stages in the ventral pathway. In either case, the dynamics of contour information in V4 and PIT appear to reflect a sequential hierarchical process of shape synthesis.},

This review captures our current knowledge of V4, largely derived from electrophysiological and imaging studies in the macaque monkey. Based on recent discovery of functionally specific domains in V4, we propose that the unifying function of V4 circuitry is to enable selective extraction of specific functional domain-based networks, whether it be by bottom-up specification of object features or by top-down attentionally driven selection.},

Theorists have long predicted that neurons would encode medial axis or skeletal object shape, yet recent studies reveal instead neural coding of boundary or surface shape. Here, we addressed this theoretical/experimental disconnect, using adaptive shape sampling to demonstrate explicit coding of medial axis shape in high-level object cortex (macaque monkey inferotemporal cortex or IT). Our metric shape analyses revealed a coding continuum, along which most neurons represent a configuration of both medial axis and surface components. Thus, IT response functions embody a rich basis set for simultaneously representing skeletal and external shape of complex objects. This would be especially useful for representing biological shapes, which are often characterized by both complex, articulated skeletal structure and specific surface features.},

Sparse coding in early visual cortex is achieved by abstracting local oriented spatial frequencies and by excitatory/inhibitory surround modulation. Object responses are thought to be sparse at subsequent processing stages, but neural mechanisms for higher-level sparsification are not known. Here, convergent results from macaque area V4 neural recording and simulated V4 populations trained on natural object contours suggest that sparse coding is achieved in midlevel visual cortex by emphasizing representation of acute convex and concave curvature. We studied 165 V4 neurons with a random, adaptive stimulus strategy to minimize bias and explore an unlimited range of contour shapes. V4 responses were strongly weighted toward contours containing acute convex or concave curvature. In contrast, the tuning distribution in nonsparse simulated V4 populations was strongly weighted toward low curvature. But as sparseness constraints increased, the simulated tuning distribution shifted progressively toward more acute convex and concave curvature, matching the neural recording results. These findings indicate a sparse object coding scheme in midlevel visual cortex based on uncommon but diagnostic regions of acute contour curvature.},

Owing to the large and indeterminate dimensionality of object space, the neural basis of object perception has been difficult to study and remains controversial. Recent work has provided a more precise picture of how 2D and 3D object structure is encoded in intermediate and higher-level visual cortices. Yet, other studies suggest that higher-level visual cortex represents categorical identity rather than structure. Furthermore, object responses are surprisingly adaptive to changes in environmental statistics, implying that learning through evolution, development, and also shorter-term experience during adulthood may optimize the object code. Future progress in reconciling these findings will depend on more effective sampling of the object domain and direct comparison of these competing hypotheses.},

  abstract        = {Object recognition in primates is mediated by the ventral visual pathway and is classically described as a feedforward hierarchy of increasingly sophisticated representations. Neurons in macaque monkey area V4, an intermediate stage along the ventral pathway, have been shown to exhibit selectivity to complex boundary conformation and invariance to spatial translation. How could such a representation be derived from the signals in lower visual areas such as V1? We show that a quantitative model of hierarchical processing, which is part of a larger model of object recognition in the ventral pathway, provides a plausible mechanism for the translation-invariant shape representation observed in area V4. Simulated model neurons successfully reproduce V4 selectivity and invariance through a nonlinear, translation-invariant combination of locally selective subunits, suggesting that a similar transformation may occur or culminate in area V4. Specifically, this mechanism models the selectivity of individual V4 neurons to boundary conformation stimuli, exhibits the same degree of translation invariance observed in V4, and produces observed V4 population responses to bars and non-Cartesian gratings. This work provides a quantitative model of the widely described shape selectivity and invariance properties of area V4 and points toward a possible canonical mechanism operating throughout the ventral pathway.},

Shape information at the retinal level is hopelessly complex, variable and implicit. The ventral pathway must somehow transform retinal signals into much more compact, stable and explicit representations of object shape. Recent findings highlight key aspects of this transformation: higher-order contour derivatives, structural representation in object-based coordinates, composite shape tuning dimensions, and long-term storage of object knowledge. These coding principles could help to explain our remarkable ability to perceive, distinguish, remember and understand a virtual infinity of objects.},

Here, we present evidence for a dynamic process of object part integration in macaque posterior inferotemporal cortex (IT). Immediately after stimulus onset, neural responses carried information about individual object parts (simple contour fragments) only. Subsequently, information about specific multipart configurations emerged, building gradually over the course of approximately 60 ms, producing a sparser and more explicit representation of object shape. We show that this gradual transformation can be explained by a recurrent network process that effectively compares parts signals across neurons to generate inferences about multipart shape configurations.},

We measured responses of 452 area V4 neurons to stimuli with disparities ranging from -1.0 to +1.0 degrees. Asymmetric Gaussian functions fit the raw data best (median R = 0.90), capturing both the modal components (local peaks in the -1.0 to +1.0 degrees range) and the monotonic components (linear or sigmoidal dependency on disparity) of the tuning patterns. Values derived from the asymmetric Gaussian fits were used to characterize neurons on a modal x monotonic tuning domain. Points along the modal tuning axis correspond to classic tuned excitatory and inhibitory patterns; points along the monotonic axis correspond to classic near and far patterns. The distribution on this domain was continuous, with the majority of neurons exhibiting a mixed modal/monotonic tuning pattern. The distribution in the modal dimension was shifted toward excitatory patterns, consistent with previous results in other areas. The distribution in the monotonic dimension was shifted toward tuning for crossed disparities (corresponding to stimuli nearer than the fixation plane). This could reflect a perceptual emphasis on objects or object parts closer to the observer. We also found that disparity-tuning strength was positively correlated with orientation-tuning strength and color-tuning strength, and negatively correlated with receptive field eccentricity.},

Here we provide a description of fundamental quantitative principles governing neural selectivity for complex shape in IT. By measuring responses to large, parametric sets of two-dimensional (2D) silhouette shapes, we found that neurons in posterior IT (Brodmann's areas TEO and posterior TE) integrate information about multiple contour elements (straight and curved edge fragments of the type represented in lower-level areas) using both linear and nonlinear mechanisms. This results in complex, distributed response patterns that cannot be characterized solely in terms of example stimuli. We explained these response patterns with tuning functions in multidimensional shape space and accurately predicted neural responses to the widely varying shapes in our stimulus set. Integration of contour element information in earlier stages of IT represents an important step in the transformation from low-level shape signals to complex object representation.},

We studied the population code for shape in area V4 of macaque monkeys, which is part of the ventral (object-related) pathway in primate visual cortex. We have previously found that many macaque V4 neurons are tuned for the curvature and object-centered position of boundary fragments (such as 'concavity on the right'). Here we tested the hypothesis that populations of such cells represent complete shapes as aggregates of boundary fragments. To estimate the population representation of a given shape, we scaled each cell's tuning peak by its response to that shape, summed across cells and smoothed. The resulting population response surface contained 3-8 peaks that represented major boundary features and could be used to reconstruct (approximately) the original shape. This exemplifies how a multi-peaked neural population response can represent a complex stimulus in terms of its constituent elements.},

  abstract        = {Tuning for the orientation of elongated, linear image elements (edges, bars, gratings), first discovered by Hubel and Wiesel, is considered a key feature of visual processing in the brain. It has been studied extensively in two dimensions (2D) using frontoparallel stimuli, but in real life most lines, edges and contours are slanted with respect to the viewer. Here we report that neurons in macaque area V4, an intermediate stage in the ventral (object-related) pathway of visual cortex, were tuned for 3D orientation--that is,for specific slants as well as for 2D orientation. The tuning for 3D orientation was consistent across depth position (binocular disparity) and position within the 2D classical receptive field. The existence of 3D orientation signals in the ventral pathway suggests that the brain may use such information to interpret 3D shape.},

Area V4 is an important intermediate stage in this pathway, and provides the major input to the final stages in inferotemporal cortex. The role of V4 in processing shape information is not yet clear. We studied V4 responses to contour features (angles and curves), which many theorists have proposed as intermediate shape primitives. We used a large parametric set of contour features to test the responses of 152 V4 cells in two awake macaque monkeys. Most cells responded better to contour features than to edges or bars, and about one-third exhibited systematic tuning for contour features. In particular, many cells were selective for contour feature orientation, responding to angles and curves pointing in a particular direction. There was a strong bias toward convex (as opposed to concave) features, implying a neural basis for the well-known perceptual dominance of convexity. Our results suggest that V4 processes information about contour features as a step toward complex shape recognition.},

  abstract        = {The midlevel visual cortical area V4 in the primate is thought to be critical for the neural representation of visual shape. Several studies agree that V4 neurons respond to contour features, e.g., convexities and concavities along a shape boundary, that are more complex than the oriented segments encoded by neurons in the primary visual cortex. Here we compare two distinct approaches to modeling V4 shape selectivity: one based on a spectral receptive field (SRF) map in the orientation and spatial frequency domain and the other based on a map in an object-centered angular position and contour curvature space. We test the ability of these two characterizations to account for the responses of V4 neurons to a set of parametrically designed two-dimensional shapes recorded previously in the awake macaque. We report two lines of evidence suggesting that the SRF model does not capture the contour sensitivity of V4 neurons. First, the SRF model discards spatial phase information, which is inconsistent with the neuronal data. Second, the amount of variance explained by the SRF model was significantly less than that explained by the contour curvature model. Notably, cells best fit by the curvature model were poorly fit by the SRF model, the latter being appropriate for a subset of V4 neurons that appear to be orientation tuned. These limitations of the SRF model suggest that a full understanding of midlevel shape representation requires more complicated models that preserve phase information and perhaps deal with object segmentation.},

  abstract        = {Past studies of shape coding in visual cortical area V4 have demonstrated that neurons can accurately represent isolated shapes in terms of their component contour features. However, rich natural scenes contain many partially occluded objects, which have "accidental" contours at the junction between the occluded and occluding objects. These contours do not represent the true shape of the occluded object and are known to be perceptually discounted. To discover whether V4 neurons differentially encode accidental contours, we studied the responses of single neurons in fixating monkeys to complex shapes and contextual stimuli presented either in isolation or adjoining each other to provide a percept of partial occlusion. Responses to preferred contours were suppressed when the adjoining context rendered those contours accidental. The observed suppression was reversed when the partial occlusion percept was compromised by introducing a small gap between the component stimuli. Control experiments demonstrated that these results likely depend on contour geometry at T-junctions and cannot be attributed to mechanisms based solely on local color/luminance contrast, spatial proximity of stimuli, or the spatial frequency content of images. Our findings provide novel insights into how occluded objects, which are fundamental to complex visual scenes, are encoded in area V4. They also raise the possibility that the weakened encoding of accidental contours at the junction between objects could mark the first step of image segmentation along the ventral visual pathway.},

  abstract        = {The primate brain successfully recognizes objects, even when they are partially occluded. To begin to elucidate the neural substrates of this perceptual capacity, we measured the responses of shape-selective neurons in visual area V4 while monkeys discriminated pairs of shapes under varying degrees of occlusion. We found that neuronal shape selectivity always decreased with increasing occlusion level, with some neurons being notably more robust to occlusion than others. The responses of neurons that maintained their selectivity across a wider range of occlusion levels were often sufficiently sensitive to support behavioral performance. Many of these same neurons were distinctively selective for the curvature of local boundary features and their shape tuning was well fit by a model of boundary curvature (curvature-tuned neurons). A significant subset of V4 neurons also signaled the animal's upcoming behavioral choices; these decision signals had short onset latencies that emerged progressively later for higher occlusion levels. The time course of the decision signals in V4 paralleled that of shape selectivity in curvature-tuned neurons: shape selectivity in curvature-tuned neurons, but not others, emerged earlier than the decision signals. These findings provide evidence for the involvement of contour-based mechanisms in the segmentation and recognition of partially occluded objects, consistent with psychophysical theory. Furthermore, they suggest that area V4 participates in the representation of the relevant sensory signals and the generation of decision signals underlying discrimination.},

Whereas synaptic plasticity, an important cellular mechanism, has been studied in great detail, we know much less about how learning is implemented at the level of neuronal circuits and, in particular, how interactions between distinct types of neurons within local networks contribute to the process of learning. Here we show that acquisition of associative fear memories depends on the recruitment of a disinhibitory microcircuit in the mouse auditory cortex. Fear-conditioning-associated disinhibition in auditory cortex is driven by foot-shock-mediated cholinergic activation of layer 1 interneurons, in turn generating inhibition of layer 2/3 parvalbumin-positive interneurons. Importantly, pharmacological or optogenetic block of pyramidal neuron disinhibition abolishes fear learning. Together, these data demonstrate that stimulus convergence in the auditory cortex is necessary for associative fear learning to complex tones, define the circuit elements mediating this convergence and suggest that layer-1-mediated disinhibition is an important mechanism underlying learning and information processing in neocortical circuits.},

We investigated their in vivo impact by expressing channelrhodopsin in three main sources of feedback to rat S1: primary motor cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, and secondary somatosensory thalamic nucleus (the posterior medial nucleus, POm). Inputs from cortical areas were relatively weak. POm, however, more robustly depolarized L2/3 cells and, when paired with peripheral stimulation, evoked action potentials. POm triggered not only a stronger fast-onset depolarization but also a delayed all-or-none persistent depolarization, lasting up to 1 s and exhibiting alpha/beta-range oscillations. Inactivating POm somata abolished persistent but not initial depolarization, indicating a recurrent circuit mechanism. We conclude that secondary thalamus can enhance L2/3 responsiveness over long periods. Such timescales could provide a potential modality-specific substrate for attention, working memory, and plasticity.},

V1 innervates and influences the superior colliculus. Here, we find that, in turn, superior colliculus modulates responses in mouse V1. Optogenetically inhibiting the superior colliculus reduces responses in V1 to optimally sized stimuli. Superior colliculus could influence V1 via its strong projection to the lateral posterior nucleus (LP/Pulvinar) or its weaker projection to the dLGN. Inhibiting superior colliculus strongly reduces activity in LP. Pharmacologically silencing LP itself, however, does not remove collicular modulation of V1. The modulation is instead due to a collicular gain modulation of the dLGN. Surround suppression operating in V1 explains the different effects for differently sized stimuli. Computations of visual saliency in the superior colliculus can thus influence tuning in the visual cortex via a tectogeniculate pathway.},

  abstract        = {High calorie foods and beverages, which often contain caffeine, contribute to child overweight/obesity. We evaluated the results of an educational intervention to promote healthy growth in very young children. Secondarily, we used detailed diet data to explore the association of nutrient intake with the early development of overweight and obesity. Mothers were obese Latina women, enrolled prenatally, and their infants. Specially trained community health workers provided breastfeeding support and nutrition education during 10 home visits, birth to 24 months. At follow-up, age 18-36 months, we measured growth and completed detailed diet recalls (1-7 recall days/child). Of 174 infants randomized, 106 children were followed for 24-36 months. The educational intervention did not prevent overweight/obesity. Forty-two percent of children became overweight or obese. Fifty-eight percent of children consumed caffeine on at least one recall day. Mean intake was 0.48 mg/kg/day. Caffeine correlated with higher consumption of calories, and added sugar and decreased intake of protein, fiber and dairy. Compared with days without caffeine, on days when caffeine was consumed, children ingested 121 more calories and 3.8 gm less protein. Children frequently consumed less than the recommended daily intake of key nutrients such as fiber, vegetables, whole fruit, and vitamins. Caffeine was a marker for increased intake of calories and decreased intake of key nutrients. When discussing dietary intake in early childhood, practitioners should screen for nutrient deficiency in young children and recommend limiting the intake of caffeinated foods and beverages.},

Here, we recorded wide-field neural activity, as revealed by GCaMP6s, from dorsal cortex while simultaneously monitoring orofacial movements, walking, and arousal (pupil diameter) of head-fixed mice performing a Go/NoGo visual detection task and examined the ability of task performance and spontaneous or task-related movements to predict cortical activity. A linear model was able to explain a significant fraction (33-55% of variance) of widefield dorsal cortical activity, with the largest factors being movements (facial, walk, eye), response choice (hit, miss, false alarm), and arousal and indicate that a significant fraction of trial-to-trial variability arises from both spontaneous and task-related changes in state (e.g., movements, arousal). Importantly, secondary motor cortex was highly correlated with lick rate, critical for optimal task performance (high d'), and was the first region to significantly predict the lick response on target trials. These findings suggest that secondary motor cortex is critically involved in the decision and performance of learned movements and indicate that a significant fraction of trial-to-trial variation in cortical activity results from spontaneous and task-related movements and variations in behavioral/arousal state.},

  abstract        = {Variability in cortical neuronal responses to sensory stimuli and in perceptual decision making performance is substantial. Moment-to-moment fluctuations in waking state or arousal can account for much of this variability. Yet, this variability is rarely characterized across the full spectrum of waking states, leaving the characteristics of the optimal state for sensory processing unresolved. Using pupillometry in concert with extracellular multiunit and intracellular whole-cell recordings, we found that the magnitude and reliability of visually evoked responses in primary visual cortex (V1) of awake, passively behaving male mice increase as a function of arousal and are largest during sustained locomotion periods. During these high-arousal, sustained locomotion periods, cortical neuronal membrane potential was at its most depolarized and least variable. Contrastingly, behavioral performance of mice on two distinct visual detection tasks was generally best at a range of intermediate arousal levels, but worst during high arousal with locomotion. These results suggest that large, reliable responses to visual stimuli in V1 occur at a distinct arousal level from that associated with optimal visual detection performance. Our results clarify the relation between neuronal responsiveness and the continuum of waking states, and suggest new complexities in the relation between primary sensory cortical activity and behavior.  Cortical sensory processing strongly depends on arousal. In the mouse visual system, locomotion (associated with high arousal) has previously been shown to enhance the sensory responses of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1). Yet, arousal fluctuates on a moment-to-moment basis, even during quiescent periods. The characteristics of V1 sensory processing across the continuum of arousal are unclear. Furthermore, the arousal level corresponding to optimal visual detection performance is unknown. We show that the magnitude and reliability of sensory-evoked V1 responses are monotonic increasing functions of arousal, and largest during locomotion. Visual detection behavior, however, is suboptimal during high arousal with locomotion, and usually best during intermediate arousal. Our study provides a more complete picture of the dependence of V1 sensory processing on arousal.},

  abstract        = {Focal limbic seizures often impair consciousness/awareness with major negative impact on quality of life. Recent work has shown that limbic seizures depress brainstem arousal systems, including reduced action potential firing in a key node: cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT). In vivo whole-cell recordings have not previously been achieved in PPT, but are used here with the goal of elucidating the mechanisms of reduced PPT cholinergic neuronal activity. An established model of focal limbic seizures was used in rats following brief hippocampal stimulation under light anesthesia. Whole-cell in vivo recordings were obtained from PPT neurons using custom-fabricated 9-10 mm tapered patch pipettes, and cholinergic neurons were identified histologically. Average membrane potential, input resistance, membrane potential fluctuations and variance were analyzed during seizures. A subset of PPT neurons exhibited reduced firing and hyperpolarization during seizures and stained positive for choline acetyltransferase. These PPT neurons showed a mean membrane potential hyperpolarization of -3.82 mV (±0.81 SEM, P < .05) during seizures, and also showed significantly increased input resistance, fewer excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP)-like events (P < .05), and reduced membrane potential variance (P < .01). The combination of increased input resistance, decreased EPSP-like events and decreased variance weigh against active ictal inhibition and support withdrawal of excitatory input as the dominant mechanism of decreased activity of cholinergic neurons in the PPT. Further identifying synaptic mechanisms of depressed arousal during seizures may lead to new treatments to improve ictal and postictal cognition.},

In this study, we examine the multielement ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) of adult male C57Bl/6J mice and specifically assess their temporal properties and organization. We found that male mice produce two classes of USVs which display unique temporal features and arise from discrete respiratory patterns. We also observed that nearly all USVs were produced in repetitive series exhibiting a hierarchical organization and a stereotyped rhythmic structure. Furthermore, series rhythmicity alone was determined to be sufficient for the mathematical discrimination of USVs produced by adult males, adult females, and pups, underscoring the known importance of call timing in USV perception. Finally, the gross spectrotemporal features of male USVs were found to develop continuously from birth and stabilize by P50, suggesting that USV production in infants and adults relies on common biological mechanisms. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the temporal organization of multielement mouse USVs is both stable and informative, and we propose that call timing be explicitly assessed when examining mouse USV production. Furthermore, this is the first report of putative USV classes arising from distinct articulatory patterns in mice, and is the first to empirically define multielement USV series and provide a detailed description of their temporal structure and development. This study therefore represents an important point of reference for the analysis of mouse USVs, a commonly used metric of social behavior in mouse models of human disease, and furthers the understanding of vocalization production in an accessible mammalian species.},

A complex genetic aetiology is presumed in most, with monogenic mutations in   accounting for >5% of cases. To identify rare, causal CNV in patients with RE. We used high-density SNP arrays to analyse the presence of rare CNVs in 186 patients with RE from the UK, the USA, Sardinia, Argentina and Kerala, India. We identified 84 patients with one or more rare CNVs, and, within this group, 14 (7.5%) with recurrent risk factor CNVs and 15 (8.0%) with likely pathogenic CNVs. Nine patients carried recurrent hotspot CNVs including at 16p13.11 and 1p36, with the most striking finding that four individuals (three from Sardinia) carried a duplication, and one a deletion, at Xp22.31. Five patients with RE carried a rare CNV that disrupted genes associated with other epilepsies ( ,  ,   and  ), and 17 cases carried CNVs that disrupted genes associated with other neurological conditions or that are involved in neuronal signalling/development. Network analysis of disrupted genes with high brain expression identified significant enrichment in pathways of the cholinergic synapse, guanine-exchange factor activation and the mammalian target of rapamycin. Our results provide a CNV profile of an ethnically diverse cohort of patients with RE, uncovering new areas of research focus, and emphasise the importance of studying non-western European populations in oligogenic disorders to uncover a full picture of risk variation.},

To characterize the effects of RFR exposure on body temperature in relation to animal size and pregnancy, a series of short-term toxicity studies was conducted in a unique RFR exposure system. Young and old B6C3F1 mice and young, old, and pregnant Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) or Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) RFR (rats = 900 MHz, mice = 1,900 MHz) at specific absorption rates (SARs) up to 12 W/kg for approximately 9 h a day for 5 days. In general, fewer and less severe increases in body temperature were observed in young than in older rats. SAR-dependent increases in subcutaneous body temperatures were observed at exposures ≥6 W/kg in both modulations. Exposures of  ≥10 W/kg GSM or CDMA RFR induced excessive increases in body temperature, leading to mortality. There was also a significant increase in the number of resorptions in pregnant rats at 12 W/kg GSM RFR. In mice, only sporadic increases in body temperature were observed regardless of sex or age when exposed to GSM or CDMA RFR up to 12 W/kg. These results identified SARs at which measurable RFR-mediated thermal effects occur, and were used in the selection of exposures for subsequent toxicology and carcinogenicity studies.

The system requirements for this 2-year NTP cancer bioassay study were the tightly-controlled lifetime exposure of rodents (1568 rats and 1512 mice) to three power levels plus sham simulating typical daily, and higher, exposures of users of GSM and CDMA (IS95) signals. Reverberation chambers and animal housing were designed to allow extended exposure time per day for free-roaming individually-housed animals. The performance of the chamber was characterized in terms of homogeneity, stirred to unstirred energy, efficiency. The achieved homogeneity was 0.59 dB and 0.48 dB at 900 and 1900 MHz respectively. The temporal variation in the electric field strength was optimized to give similar characteristics to that of the power control of a phone in a real network using the two stirrers. Experimental dosimetry was performed to validate the SAR sensitivity and determine the SAR uniformity throughout the exposure volume; SAR uniformities of 0.46 dB and 0.40 dB, respectively, for rats and mice were achieved.},

  abstract        = {Inhibitory interneurons are an important source of synaptic inputs that may contribute to network mechanisms for coding of spatial location by entorhinal cortex (EC). The intrinsic properties of inhibitory interneurons in the EC of the mouse are mostly undescribed. Intrinsic properties were recorded from known cell types, such as, stellate and pyramidal cells and 6 classes of molecularly identified interneurons (regulator of calcineurin 2, somatostatin, serotonin receptor 3a, neuropeptide Y neurogliaform (NGF), neuropeptide Y non-NGF, and vasoactive intestinal protein) in acute brain slices. We report a broad physiological diversity between and within cell classes. We also found differences in the ability to produce postinhibitory rebound spikes and in the frequency and amplitude of incoming EPSPs. To understand the source of this intrinsic variability we applied hierarchical cluster analysis to functionally classify neurons. These analyses revealed physiologically derived cell types in EC that mostly corresponded to the lines identified by biomarkers with a few unexpected and important differences. Finally, we reduced the complex multidimensional space of intrinsic properties to the most salient five that predicted the cellular biomolecular identity with 81.4% accuracy. These results provide a framework for the classification of functional subtypes of cortical neurons by their intrinsic membrane properties.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present the detailed life-time dosimetry analysis for rodents exposed in the reverberation exposure system designed for the two-year cancer bioassay study conducted by the National Toxicology Program of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The study required the well-controlled and characterized exposure of individually housed, unrestrained mice at 1900 MHz and rats at 900 MHz, frequencies chosen to give best uniformity exposure of organs and tissues. The wbSAR, the peak spatial SAR and the organ specific SAR as well as the uncertainty and variation due to the exposure environment, differences in the growth rates, and animal posture were assessed. Compared to the wbSAR, the average exposure of the high-water-content tissues (blood, heart, lung) were higher by ~4 dB, while the low-loss tissues (bone and fat) were less by ~9 dB. The maximum uncertainty over the exposure period for the SAR was estimated to be <49% (k=2) for the rodents whereas the relative uncertainty between the group was <14% (k=1). The instantaneous variation (averaged over 1 min) was <13% (k=1), which is small compared to other long term exposure research projects. These detailed dosimetric results empowers comparison with other studies and provides a reference for studies of long-term biological effects of exposure of rodents to RF energy.},

  abstract        = {Sleep apnea, which is the periodic cessation of breathing during sleep, is a major health problem affecting over 10 million people in the United States and is associated with several sequelae, including hypertension and stroke. Clinical studies suggest that abnormal carotid body (CB) activity may be a driver of sleep apnea. Because gaseous molecules are important determinants of CB activity, aberrations in their signaling could lead to sleep apnea. Here, we report that mice deficient in heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2), which generates the gaseous molecule carbon monoxide (CO), exhibit sleep apnea characterized by high apnea and hypopnea indices during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Similar high apnea and hypopnea indices were also noted in prehypertensive spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats, which are known to exhibit CB hyperactivity. We identified the gaseous molecule hydrogen sulfide (H S) as the major effector molecule driving apneas. Genetic ablation of the H S-synthesizing enzyme cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE) normalized breathing in HO-2  mice. Pharmacologic inhibition of CSE with l-propargyl glycine prevented apneas in both HO-2  mice and SH rats. These observations demonstrate that dysregulated CO and H S signaling in the CB leads to apneas and suggest that CSE inhibition may be a useful therapeutic intervention for preventing CB-driven sleep apnea.},

We determined the interactions between nasopharyngeal microbial pathogens and commensals during viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI) and acute otitis media (AOM) in infants. We analyzed 971 specimens collected monthly and during URI and AOM episodes from 139 infants. The 16S rRNA V4 gene regions were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Among the high abundant genus-level nasopharyngeal microbiota were Moraxella, Haemophilus, and Streptococcus (3 otopathogen genera), Corynebacterium, Dolosigranulum, Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Bifidobacterium. Bacterial diversity was lower in culture-positive samples for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, compared to cultured-negative samples. URI frequencies were positively associated with increasing trend in otopathogen colonization. AOM frequencies were associated with decreasing trend in Micrococcus colonization. During URI and AOM, there were increases in abundance of otopathogen genera and decreases in Pseudomonas, Myroides, Yersinia, and Sphingomonas. Otopathogen abundance was increased during symptomatic viral infection, but not during asymptomatic infection. The risk for AOM complicating URI was reduced by increased abundance of Staphylococcus and Sphingobium. Otopathogen genera played the key roles in URI and AOM occurrences. Staphylococcus counteracts otopathogens thus Staphylococcal colonization may be beneficial, rather than harmful. While Sphingobium may play a role in preventing AOM complicating URI, the commonly used probiotic Bifidobacterium did not play a significant role during URI or AOM. The role of less common commensals in counteracting the deleterious effects of otopathogens requires further studies.},

  abstract        = {Oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) induced in F344 rats by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) demonstrate considerable phenotypic similarity to human oral cancers and the model has been widely used for carcinogenesis and chemoprevention studies. Molecular characterization of this model needs reliable reference genes (RGs) to avoid false- positive and -negative results for proper interpretation of gene expression data between tumor and adjacent normal tissues. Microarray analysis of 11 pairs of OSCC and site-matched phenotypically normal oral tissues from 4-NQO-treated rats identified 10 stably expressed genes in OSCC compared to adjacent normal tissues (p>0.5, CV<15%) that could serve as potential RGs in this model. The commonly used 27 RGs in the rat were also analyzed based on microarray data and most of them were found unsuitable for RGs in this model. Traditional RGs such as ACTB and GAPDH were significantly altered in OSCC compared to adjacent normal tissues (p<0.01, n=11); however, the Hsp90ab1 was ranked as the best RG candidate and the combination of Hsp90ab1 and HPRT1 was identified by NormFinder to be a superior reference for gene normalization among the commonly used RGs. This result was also validated by RT-PCR based on the selected top RG candidate pool. These data suggest that there are no common RGs suitable for different models and RG(s) should be identified before gene expression analysis. We successfully identified Hsp90ab1 as a stable RG in 4-NQO-induced OSCC compared to adjacent normal tissues in F344 rats. The combination of two stably expressed genes may be a better option for gene normalization in tissue samples.},

In previous genome-wide analysis, we had reported linkage of centrotemporal sharp waves to chromosome 11p13, and fine mapping with 44 SNPs identified the ELP4-PAX6 locus in two independent US and Canadian case-control samples. Here, we aimed to find a causative variant for centrotemporal sharp waves using a larger sample and higher resolution genotyping array. We fine-mapped the ELP4-PAX6 locus in 186 individuals from rolandic epilepsy families and 1000 population controls of European origin using the Illumina HumanCoreExome-12 v1.0 BeadChip. Controls were matched to cases on ethnicity using principal component analysis. We used generalized estimating equations to assess association, followed up with a bioinformatics survey and literature search to evaluate functional significance. Homozygosity at the T allele of SNP rs662702 in the 3' untranslated region of PAX6 conferred increased risk of CTS: Odds ratio = 12.29 (95% CI: 3.20-47.22), P = 2.6 × 10(-4) and is seen in 3.9% of cases but only 0.3% of controls. The minor T allele of SNP rs662702 disrupts regulation by microRNA-328, which is known to result in increased PAX6 expression in vitro. This study provides, for the first time, evidence of a noncoding genomic variant contributing to the etiology of a common human epilepsy via a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of symptoms and other risk factors in predicting the presence of AOM in infants. Healthy infants, age less than four weeks, were enrolled and followed prospectively for up to age one year. Infants were scheduled for a research visit when their parents noted the onset of symptoms. At each URI visit, parents first reported the severity of symptoms. An investigator then diagnosed the presence or absence of concurrent AOM. Risk factors and symptom scores for infants with and without AOM were studied. Infants (N=193, mean age at first URI 3.9±2.5 months) experienced 360 URI episodes and 63 AOM events. Symptoms consisting of fever, earache, poor feeding, restless sleep, and irritability together (ETG-5) were statistically associated with the prediction of AOM (P=0.006). A multiple variable statistical model (J-Score) that included day care attendance, age, severity of cough and earache best predicted AOM (P<0.001), with 95% specificity. Both ETG-5 and J-score yielded relatively low sensitivity for AOM prediction. In infants with URI in the first year of life, severity of symptoms was significantly associated with concurrent AOM. Daycare attendance, presence and severity of earache and cough added to better correlation. These observations may have clinical application in identification of infants at risk for AOM.},

  abstract        = {Cortical feedback pathways are hypothesized to distribute context-dependent signals during flexible behavior. Recent experimental work has attempted to understand the mechanisms by which cortical feedback inputs modulate their target regions. Within the mouse whisker sensorimotor system, cortical feedback stimulation modulates spontaneous activity and sensory responsiveness, leading to enhanced sensory representations. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these effects are currently unknown. In this study we use a simplified neural circuit model, which includes two recurrent excitatory populations and global inhibition, to simulate cortical modulation. First, we demonstrate how changes in the strengths of excitation and inhibition alter the input-output processing responses of our model. Second, we compare these responses with experimental findings from cortical feedback stimulation. Our analyses predict that enhanced inhibition underlies the changes in spontaneous and sensory evoked activity observed experimentally. More generally, these analyses provide a framework for relating cellular and synaptic properties to emergent circuit function and dynamic modulation.},

  abstract        = {The preventive efficacy of the triterpenoid 5MeCDDO was tested in two models of mammary cancer, the Min model of intestinal cancer, and a chemically induced model of head and neck cancer. In one model of mammary cancer, female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered MNU at 50 days of age, and 5MeCDDO (27 ppm) was administered in the diet beginning 5 days later for the duration of the study; 5MeCDDO was ineffective. In contrast, in a model examining initiation of mammary cancers by the procarcinogen dimethyl-benzanthracene, 5, 6-benzoflavone (500 ppm, an Ah receptor agonist) or 5MeCDDO (27 or 2.7 ppm) decreased tumor multiplicity by 90%, 80%, and 50%, respectively. This anti-initiating effect which is presumably mediated by altered metabolic activation parallels our observation that 5MeCDDO induced proteins of various antioxidant response element (ARE)-related phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes [e.g., GST Pi, AKR 7A3 (aflatoxicol), epoxide hydrolase, and quinone reductase] in the liver. 5MeCDDO tested in the 4-nitroquinoline-l-oxide (4-NQO) head and neck cancer model failed to decrease tumor incidence or invasiveness. In the Min mouse model of intestinal cancer, a high dose of 5MeCDDO (80 ppm) was weakly effective in reducing adenoma multiplicity [∼30% (P < 0.05)]; however, a lower dose was totally ineffective. These findings question whether measuring increased levels of certain ARE-related genes (e.g., quinone reductase, GST Pi), indicating decreased carcinogen activation are sufficient to imply general chemopreventive efficacy of a given agent or mixture.

  abstract        = {The high prevalence and impact of neurodevelopmental comorbidities in childhood epilepsy are now well known, as are the increased risks and familial aggregation of reading disability (RD) and speech sound disorder (SSD) in rolandic epilepsy (RE). The risk factors for RD in the general population include male sex, SSD, and ADHD, but it is not known if these are the same in RE or whether there is a contributory role of seizure and treatment-related variables. An observational study of 108 probands with RE (age range: 3.6-22 years) and their 159 siblings (age range: 1-29 years; 83 with EEG data) were singly ascertained in the US or UK through a proband affected by RE. We used a nested case-control design, multiple logistic regression, and generalized estimating equations to test the hypothesis of an association between RD and seizure variables or antiepileptic drug treatment in RE; we also assessed an association between EEG focal sharp waves and RD in siblings. Reading disability was reported in 42% of probands and 22% of siblings. Among probands, RD was strongly associated with a history of SSD (OR: 9.64, 95% CI: 2.45-37.21), ADHD symptoms (OR: 10.31, 95% CI: 2.15-49.44), and male sex (OR: 3.62, 95% CI: 1.11-11.75) but not with seizure or treatment variables. Among siblings, RD was independently associated only with SSD (OR: 4.30, 95% CI: 1.42-13.0) and not with the presence of interictal EEG focal sharp waves. The principal risk factors for RD in RE are SSD, ADHD, and male sex, the same risk factors as for RD without epilepsy. Seizure or treatment variables do not appear to be important risk factors for RD in probands with RE, and there was no evidence to support interictal EEG focal sharp waves as a risk factor for RD in siblings. Future studies should focus on the precise neuropsychological characterization of RD in families with RE and on the effectiveness of standard oral-language and reading interventions.},

  abstract        = {The term Pontocerebellar hypoplasias collectively refers to a group of rare, heterogeneous and progressive disorders, which are frequently inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and usually have a prenatal onset. Mutations in the SEPSECS gene, leading to deficiency in selenoprotein biosynthesis, have been identified in recent times as the molecular etiology of different pre/perinatal onset neurological phenotypes, including cerebello-cerebral atrophy, Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2D and progressive encephalopathy with elevated lactate. These disorders share a similar spectrum of central (e.g., brain neurodegeneration with grey and white matter both involved) and peripheral (e.g., spasticity due to axonal neuropathy) nervous system impairment. We hereby describe a 9-year-old boy with (i) a typical Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2D phenotype (e.g. profound mental retardation, spastic quadriplegia, ponto-cerebellar hypoplasia and progressive cerebral atrophy); (ii) optic nerve atrophy and (iii) mild secondary mitochondrial myopathy detected by muscle biopsy and respiratory chain enzyme analysis. We performed whole exome sequencing which identified a homozygous mutation of the SEPSECS gene (c.1001T > C), confirming the clinical suspect of Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2D. This report further corroborates the notion of a potential secondary mitochondrial dysfunction in the context of selenoprotein biosynthesis deficiency and also adds optic nerve atrophy as a new potential clinical feature within the SEPSECS-associated clinical spectrum. These findings suggest the presence of a possible shared genetic etiology among similar clinical entities characterized by the combination of progressive cerebello-cerebral and optic nerve atrophy and also stress the biological importance of selenoproteins in the regulation of neuronal and metabolic homeostasis.},

  abstract        = {Peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In vivo studies were performed to evaluate the activities of two thiazolidinedione PPARγ agonists, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, as inhibitors of oral carcinogenesis in rats. Oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) were induced in male F344 rats by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (NQO; 20 ppm in the drinking water for 10 weeks). In each study, groups of 30 NQO-treated rats were exposed to a PPARγ agonist beginning at week 10 (one day after completion of NQO administration) or at week 17 (7 weeks post-NQO); chemopreventive agent exposure was continued until study termination at week 22 (rosiglitazone study) or week 24 (pioglitazone study). Administration of rosiglitazone (800 mg/kg diet) beginning at week 10 increased survival, reduced oral cancer incidence, and reduced oral cancer invasion score in comparison to dietary controls; however, chemopreventive activity was largely lost when rosiglitazone administration was delayed until week 17. Administration of pioglitazone (500 mg/kg diet beginning at week 10 or 1000 mg/kg diet beginning at week 17) induced significant reductions in oral cancer incidence without significant effects on OSCC invasion scores. Transcript levels of PPARγ and its three transcriptional variants (PPARγv1, PPARγv2, and PPARγv3) were not significantly different in OSCC versus age- and site-matched phenotypically normal oral tissues from rats treated with NQO. These data suggest that PPARγ provides a useful molecular target for oral cancer chemoprevention, and that overexpression of PPARγ at the transcriptional level in neoplastic lesions is not essential for chemopreventive efficacy.},

Pharmacokinetic evaluation was carried out in cynomolgus monkeys in support of an ongoing phase I study of the PO combination of FdCyd and the CD inhibitor tetrahydrouridine (THU; NSC112907). Animals were dosed intravenously (IV) or per os (PO). Plasma samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS for FdCyd, metabolites, and THU. Clinical chemistry and hematology were performed at various times after dosing. A pilot pharmacokinetic study was performed in humans to assess FdCyd bioavailability. After IV FdCyd and THU administration, FdCyd C(max) and AUC increased with dose. FdCyd half-life ranged between 22 and 56 min, and clearance was approximately 15 mL/min/kg. FdCyd PO bioavailability after THU ranged between 9 and 25 % and increased with increasing THU dose. PO bioavailability of THU was less than 5 %, but did result in plasma concentrations associated with inhibition of its target CD. Human pilot studies showed comparable bioavailability for FdCyd (10 %) and THU (4.1 %). Administration of THU with FdCyd increased the exposure to FdCyd and improved PO FdCyd bioavailability from <1 to 24 %. Concentrations of THU and FdCyd achieved after PO administration are associated with CD inhibition and hypomethylation, respectively. The schedule currently studied in phase I studies of PO FdCyd and THU is daily times three at the beginning of the first and second weeks of a 28-day cycle.},

We determined the prevalence of viral URI and its complications, including acute otitis media (AOM) and LRI, and assessed the effect of bacterial-viral interactions, and genetic and environmental risks on AOM development. Healthy infants were enrolled from near birth and followed to the first episode of AOM up to 12 months of age. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected at monthly intervals (months 1-6, 9) and during viral URI episodes for bacterial culture and viral polymerase chain reaction studies. Subjects were followed closely for AOM development. A total of 367 infants were followed for 286 child-years; 887 URI (305 infants) and 180 AOM episodes (143 infants) were documented. Prevalence of URI, LRI, and AOM in the first year was 3.2, 0.25, and 0.67 per child-year, respectively. Cumulative AOM incidence by ages 3, 6, and 12 months was 6%, 23%, and 46%. Infants with and without AOM had 4.7 and 2.3 URI episodes per child-year, respectively (P < .002). Pathogenic bacterial colonization rates by month were significantly higher in infants with AOM (P < .005). Breastfeeding reduced both URI and AOM risks (P < .05). Significant bacterial-viral interactions occurred with Moraxella catarrhalis and a variety of respiratory viruses and altered URI and AOM risks. Almost half of infants experienced AOM by age 1. Important AOM risk factors included frequent viral URI, pathogenic bacterial colonization, and lack of breastfeeding. Bacterial-viral interactions may play a significant role in AOM pathogenesis and deserve further investigation.},

  abstract        = {The FOXP2 gene is important for the development of proper speech motor control in humans. However, the role of the gene in general vocal behavior in other mammals, including mice, is unclear. Here, we track the vocal development of Foxp2 heterozygous knockout (Foxp2+/-) mice and their wildtype (WT) littermates from juvenile to adult ages, and observe severe abnormalities in the courtship song of Foxp2+/- mice. In comparison to their WT littermates, Foxp2+/- mice vocalized less, produced shorter syllable sequences, and possessed an abnormal syllable inventory. In addition, Foxp2+/- song also exhibited irregular rhythmic structure, and its development did not follow the consistent trajectories observed in WT vocalizations. These results demonstrate that the Foxp2 gene is critical for normal vocal behavior in juvenile and adult mice, and that Foxp2 mutant mice may provide a tractable model system for the study of the gene's role in general vocal motor control.},

  abstract        = {Staphylococcal aureus (SA) colonization in early infancy is common, but the pattern and factors affecting its acquisition and persistence in the first few months of life are not well studied. The aim is to study the rate of SA nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization at monthly intervals in the first 6 months of life and its association with environmental and host factors and other pathogenic NP bacteria. Data from a prospective study were analyzed on bacterial cultures of 1765 NP swabs from 367 infants who were followed from birth to 6 months of age. Demographic, breastfeeding, cigarette smoke exposure and day care attendance data were collected at each monthly visit. The rate of infants colonized with SA was highest at age 1 month (25%) and declined to lowest rate by age 6 months (12%). The proportion of SA strains that was methicillin-resistant SA was also highest at age 1 month and declined rapidly by age 4 months (18% vs. 6%, P = 0.05). Colonization with Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) and Moraxella catarrhalis (MC) increased at different rates up to age 6 months. Univariate analysis showed that SA colonization rate was significantly lower with increasing age, black race, day care attendance, and colonization with NTHI, MC and SP (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that this effect was independently associated only with increasing age and MC colonization (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the time to first acquisition of SA from one month of age onwards was significantly associated with day care attendance, and NTHI and MC colonization. None of the infants colonized with SA developed SA infections through age 6 months. SA colonization of NP begins very early in life and declines quickly. Methicillin-resistant SA has lower ability to maintain prolonged colonization status than methicillin-susceptible strains in the first 6 months of life. As the NP is colonized with other respiratory bacterial pathogens, the colonization with SA declines; however, this effect is stronger with Gram-negative bacteria, such as NTHI and MC.},

  abstract        = {During the generation of higher-frequency (e.g., gamma) oscillations, cortical neurons can exhibit pairwise tight (<10 ms) spike synchrony. To understand how synaptic currents contribute to rhythmic activity and spike synchrony, we performed dual whole-cell recordings in mouse entorhinal cortical slices generating periodic activity (the slow oscillation). This preparation exhibited a significant amount of gamma-coherent spike synchrony during the active phase of the slow oscillation (Up state), particularly among fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons. IPSCs arriving in pairs of either pyramidal or fast-spiking neurons during the Up state were highly synchronized and exhibited significant coherence at frequencies from 10 to 100 Hz, peaking at ∼40 Hz, suggesting both synchronous discharge of, and synaptic divergence from, nearby inhibitory neurons. By inferring synaptic currents related to spike generation in simultaneously recorded pyramidal or fast-spiking neurons, we detected a decay of inhibition ∼20 ms before spiking. In fast-spiking interneurons, this was followed by an even larger excitatory input immediately before spike generation. Consistent with an important role for phasic excitation in driving spiking, we found that the correlation of excitatory inputs was highly predictive of spike synchrony in pairs of fast-spiking interneurons. Interestingly, spike synchrony in fast-spiking interneurons was not related to the strength of gap junctional coupling, and was still prevalent in connexin 36 knock-out animals. Our results support the pyramidal-interneuron gamma model of fast rhythmic oscillation in the cerebral cortex and suggest that spike synchrony and phase preference arises from the precise interaction of excitatory-inhibitory postsynaptic currents. We dissected the cellular and synaptic basis of spike synchrony occurring at gamma frequency (30-80 Hz). We used simultaneous targeted whole-cell recordings in an active slice preparation and analyzed the relationships between synaptic inputs and spike generation. We found that both pyramidal and fast-spiking neurons receive large, coherent inhibitory synaptic inputs at gamma frequency. In addition, we found that fast-spiking interneurons receive large, phasic excitatory synaptic inputs immediately before spike generation followed shortly by synaptic inhibition. These data support the principal-interneuron gamma generation model, and reveal how the synaptic connectivity between excitatory and inhibitory neurons supports the generation of gamma oscillations and spike synchrony.},

Understanding the pathophysiology of this condition seems crucial for therapeutic design, yet few electrophysiological studies in actively degenerating animal models have been reported. Here, we report a novel preparation of acute slices from adult mouse spinal cord, allowing visualized whole cell patch-clamp recordings of fluorescent lumbar MN cell bodies from ChAT-eGFP or superoxide dismutase 1-yellow fluorescent protein (SOD1YFP) transgenic animals up to 6 mo of age. We examined 11 intrinsic electrophysiologic properties of adult ChAT-eGFP mouse MNs and classified them into four subtypes based on these parameters. The subtypes could be principally correlated with instantaneous (initial) and steady-state firing rates. We used retrograde tracing using fluorescent dye injected into fast or slow twitch lower extremity muscle with slice recordings from the fluorescent-labeled lumbar MN cell bodies to establish that fast and slow firing MNs are connected with fast and slow twitch muscle, respectively. In a G85R SOD1YFP transgenic mouse model of ALS, which becomes paralyzed by 5-6 mo, where MN cell bodies are fluorescent, enabling the same type of recording from spinal cord tissue slices, we observed that all four MN subtypes were present at 2 mo of age. At 4 mo, by which time substantial neuronal SOD1YFP aggregation and cell loss has occurred and symptoms have developed, one of the fast firing subtypes that innvervates fast twitch muscle was lost. These results begin to describe an order of the pathophysiologic events in ALS.},

We optogenetically stimulated VPM or POm axons, and recorded evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in different cell-types across cortical layers in wS1. We found that excitatory neurons and parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons received the largest EPSPs, dominated by VPM input to L4 and POm input to L5A. In contrast, somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons received very little input from either pathway in any layer. Vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing inhibitory neurons received an intermediate level of excitatory input with less apparent layer-specificity.

Tactile information, including object texture and location, appears to be computed in wS1 through integration of motor and sensory signals. wS1 also directly controls whisker movements and contributes to learned, whisker-dependent, goal-directed behaviours.

This study aimed to determine the impact this novel curriculum had on GMOs'confidence levels in 21 core privileges covering eight different subspecialties while stationed at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP). A cohort study from 2015 to 2017 was designed to address our specific aim to examine if the implementation of the STOMP curriculum increased GMOs' confidence levels. Fifty-seven participants enrolled in the study. The GMO case group completed the STOMP curriculum (n = 22), while the control or GMO self-study group (n = 35) did not complete the curriculum. Six months after starting clinical practice at NMCP, both groups completed an online survey that assessed their confidence level in performing each core privilege using a 5-point Likert scale. Scores were analyzed using a Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test. Research data were derived from an approved Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth, Virginia IRB, protocol number: NMCP.2016.0010. Participants demonstrated a statistically significant increase in self-rated confidence scores (p < 0.05) in nine core privilege skills: punch biopsy, shave biopsy, excisional biopsy, removal of otic foreign body, removal of nasal foreign body, removal of ocular foreign body, tonometry, incision and drainage of a thrombosed hemorrhoid, and reduction of simple closed fractures and dislocations. These findings suggest that a novel and recently developed standardized simulation training curriculum entitled STOMP improves the confidence levels of early career physicians' in several primary care procedural skills and is an ideal adjunct to traditional lecture-based teaching prior to independent practice in a primary care environment.},

Two-photon microscopy combined with microprisms allowed imaging of neuronal network activity across cortical layers in transgenic mice expressing a genetically encoded calcium indicator. Early-phase activity in wS1 encoded the whisker sensory stimulus and was necessary for detection of whisker stimuli. Activity in tjM1 encoded licking direction during task execution and was necessary for contralateral licking. Pre-stimulus activity in tjM1, but not wS1, was predictive of lick direction and contributed causally to small preparatory jaw movements.

  abstract     = {Ischemic preconditioning (IP) has a small benefit on exercise performance, but differences in the IP method, performance tasks and exercise modality have made providing practical coach guidelines difficult. We investigated the performance-enhancing effects of IP on cyclists by comparing the frequency of IP application over a 7-day period. Using a randomized, sham-controlled, single-blinded experiment, 24 competitive age-group track cyclists (38±12 years) were assigned to one of three twice-daily (sham: 20 and 20 mmHg; once-a-day: 20 and 220 mmHg; twice-a-day: 220 and 220 mmHg) IP leg protocols (4 × 5 min ischemia/5 min reperfusion alternating between legs) over seven consecutive days. A 4000-m cycling-ergometer time trial was completed before, immediately following and one week after the protocols. Neither mean power, nor 4000-m performance time nor VO   were significantly affected by either of the IP protocols compared to the sham at any time point following treatment. Repeated application of IP over seven days did not enhance the performance of trained cyclists in a 4000-m laboratory time trial. More research is required to understand how changes to methodological variables can improve the chances of IP successfully enhancing athlete performance.},

  abstract        = {Whisker movements are used by rodents to touch objects in order to extract spatial and textural tactile information about their immediate surroundings. To understand the mechanisms of such active sensorimotor processing it is important to investigate whisker motor control. The activity of neurons in the neocortex affects whisker movements, but many aspects of the organization of cortical whisker motor control remain unknown. Here, we filmed whisker movements evoked by sequential optogenetic stimulation of different locations across the left dorsal sensorimotor cortex of awake head-restrained mice. Whisker movements were evoked by optogenetic stimulation of many regions in the dorsal sensorimotor cortex. Optogenetic stimulation of whisker sensory barrel cortex evoked retraction of the contralateral whisker after a short latency, and a delayed rhythmic protraction of the ipsilateral whisker. Optogenetic stimulation of frontal cortex evoked rhythmic bilateral whisker protraction with a longer latency compared to stimulation of sensory cortex. Compared to frontal cortex stimulation, larger amplitude bilateral rhythmic whisking in a less protracted position was evoked at a similar latency by stimulating a cortical region posterior to Bregma and close to the midline. These data suggest that whisker motor control might be broadly distributed across the dorsal mouse sensorimotor cortex. Future experiments must investigate the complex neuronal circuits connecting specific cell-types in various cortical regions with the whisker motor neurons located in the facial nucleus.},

However, current internship structure is less rotational and focuses more on specialty-specific training. Therefore, these physicians may not be fully prepared for this primary care role. Based on the U.S. Navy privileges for General Medical Officers, a comprehensive didactic and simulation curriculum was developed. Twenty-three procedural skill competencies (SK) and five validated standardized patient (SP) scenarios were identified. During the SK portion, learners reviewed instructional videos, read reference materials, and practiced with partial task trainers before small-group sessions with subject matter experts (SME). Separate SP round-robin sessions were conducted and feedback provided by SMEs and SPs. Learners demonstrated competency or were remediated. One hundred and three PGY-1 trainees participated over 2 yr. All trainees met requirements during the SK phase. During the SP phase, seven learners required remediation. All learners ultimately met requirements for privileging. The Simulation Training for Operational Medicine Providers curriculum for future General Medical Officers is an effective tool for primary care skill training and credentialing. Plans for export to other Graduate Medical Education sites are underway and further evaluation of skills retention is warranted.},

Here, we used voltage-sensitive dye to image electrical activity in the dorsal cortex of awake head-restrained mice. Whisker-deflection evoked the earliest sensory response in a localized region of primary somatosensory cortex and visual stimulation evoked the earliest responses in a localized region of primary visual cortex. Over the next milliseconds, the initial sensory response spread within the respective primary sensory cortex and into the surrounding higher order sensory cortices. In addition, secondary hotspots in the frontal cortex were evoked by whisker and visual stimulation, with the frontal hotspot for whisker deflection being more anterior and lateral compared to the frontal hotspot evoked by visual stimulation. Investigating axonal projections, we found that the somatosensory whisker cortex and the visual cortex directly innervated frontal cortex, with visual cortex axons innervating a region medial and posterior to the innervation from somatosensory cortex, consistent with the location of sensory responses in frontal cortex. In turn, the axonal outputs of these two frontal cortical areas innervate distinct regions of striatum, superior colliculus, and brainstem. Sensory input, therefore, appears to map onto modality-specific regions of frontal cortex, perhaps participating in distinct sensorimotor transformations, and directing distinct motor outputs.},

Coaches are currently experimenting using ischaemic preconditioning (IPC) over consecutive days in the hope of improving competitive performances. First, to quantify the physiological impact of 1 week of IPC on simulated Keirin cycling performance. Second, to investigate if biochemical stress markers are affected over the treatment period. Using a randomised, sham-controlled design, 18 active adults undertook seven consecutive days of IPC treatment (4×5 min occlusion/reperfusion) applied to each leg at either 220 mm Hg (treatment, n=9) or 20 mm Hg (sham, n=9). Urinary measures of inflammation, oxidative stress and indirect nitric oxide synthesis were undertaken daily. A simulated Keirin cycling competition (4×30 s Wingate tests) was performed on day 10, with baseline and postintervention cycling VO2max (days 1, 11 and 18) and 30 s Wingate tests (day 2) undertaken for comparison. The treatment group had enhanced mean cycling power (3.4%), while neopterin and biopterin in conjunction with total neopterin were significantly lower (p<0.05) and total biopterin significantly greater (p<0.05) during the simulated Keirin. Aerobic fitness measures significantly improved from baseline to postintervention (VO2peak: 12.8% ↑, maximal aerobic power: 18.5% ↑). Seven consecutive days of IPC improved aerobic and anaerobic capacity measures, with modulations in oxidative stress, immune system activation and nitric oxide/catecholamine synthesis.},

The spatiotemporal dynamics of electrical activity in the dorsal mouse neocortex can be imaged using voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs) with near-millisecond temporal resolution and [Formula: see text] spatial resolution. Here, we trained mice to lick a water reward spout after a 1-ms deflection of the C2 whisker, and we imaged cortical dynamics during task execution with VSD RH1691. Responses to whisker deflection were highly dynamic and spatially highly distributed, exhibiting high variability from trial to trial in amplitude and spatiotemporal dynamics. We differentiated trials based on licking and whisking behavior. Hit trials, in which the mouse licked after the whisker stimulus, were accompanied by overall greater depolarization compared to miss trials, with the strongest hit versus miss differences being found in frontal cortex. Prestimulus whisking decreased behavioral performance by increasing the fraction of miss trials, and these miss trials had attenuated cortical sensorimotor responses. Our data suggest that the spatiotemporal dynamics of depolarization in mouse sensorimotor cortex evoked by a single brief whisker deflection are subject to important behavioral modulation during the execution of a simple, learned, goal-directed sensorimotor transformation.},

However, several experimental studies suggest that both wiring and synaptic weight structure between neurons show statistics that differ from random networks. Here we study a network containing a subset of neurons which we call weight-hub neurons, that are characterized by strong inward synapses. We propose a connectivity structure for excitatory neurons that contain assemblies of densely connected weight-hub neurons, while the pairwise connection probability and synaptic weight distribution remain consistent with experimental data. Simulations of such a network with generalized integrate-and-fire neurons display regular and irregular slow oscillations akin to experimentally observed up/down state transitions in the activity of cortical neurons with a broad distribution of pairwise spike correlations. Moreover, stimulation of a model network in the presence or absence of assembly structure exhibits responses similar to light-evoked responses of cortical layers in optogenetically modified animals. We conclude that a high connection probability into and within assemblies of excitatory weight-hub neurons, as it likely is present in some but not all cortical layers, changes the dynamics of a layer of cortical microcircuitry significantly.},

We investigated the effect of cold-water immersion on structural, inflammatory, and physiological stress biomarkers following a mixed martial arts (MMA) contest preparation training session in comparison with passive recovery. Semiprofessional MMA competitors (n = 15) were randomly assigned to a cold-water immersion (15 min at 10 °C) or passive recovery protocol (ambient air) completed immediately following a contest preparation training session. Markers of muscle damage (urinary myoglobin), inflammation/oxidative stress (urinary neopterin + total neopterin (neopterin + 7,8-dihydroneopterin)), and hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) activation (saliva cortisol) were determined before, immediately after, and 1, 2, and 24 h postsession. Ratings of perceived soreness and fatigue, counter movement jump, and gastrointestinal temperature were also measured. Concentrations of all biomarkers increased significantly (p < 0.05) postsession. Cold water immersion attenuated increases in urinary neopterin (p < 0.05, d = 0.58), total neopterin (p < 0.05, d = 0.89), and saliva cortisol after 2 h (p < 0.05, d = 0.68) and urinary neopterin again at 24 h (p < 0.01, d = 0.57) in comparison with passive recovery. Perceived soreness, fatigue, and gastrointestinal temperatures were also lower for the cold-water immersion group at several time points postsession whilst counter movement jump did not differ. Combative sport athletes who are subjected to impact-induced stress may benefit from immediate cold-water immersion as a simple recovery intervention that reduces delayed onset muscle soreness as well as macrophage and HPA activation whilst not impairing functional performance.},

  abstract        = {Goal-directed behavior involves distributed neuronal circuits in the mammalian brain, including diverse regions of neocortex. However, the cellular basis of long-range cortico-cortical signaling during goal-directed behavior is poorly understood. Here, we recorded membrane potential of excitatory layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in primary somatosensory barrel cortex (S1) projecting to either primary motor cortex (M1) or secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) during a whisker detection task, in which thirsty mice learn to lick for water reward in response to a whisker deflection. Whisker stimulation in 'Good performer' mice, but not 'Naive' mice, evoked long-lasting biphasic depolarization correlated with task performance in S2-projecting (S2-p) neurons, but not M1-projecting (M1-p) neurons. Furthermore, S2-p neurons, but not M1-p neurons, became excited during spontaneous unrewarded licking in 'Good performer' mice, but not in 'Naive' mice. Thus, a learning-induced, projection-specific signal from S1 to S2 may contribute to goal-directed sensorimotor transformation of whisker sensation into licking motor output.},

  abstract = {Sensory processing in neocortex is primarily driven by glutamatergic excitation, which is counterbalanced by GABAergic inhibition, mediated by a diversity of largely local inhibitory interneurons. Here, we trained mice to lick a reward spout in response to whisker deflection, and we recorded from genetically defined GABAergic inhibitory neurons in layer 2/3 of the primary somatosensory barrel cortex. Parvalbumin-expressing (PV), vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP), and somatostatin-expressing (SST) neurons displayed distinct action potential firing dynamics during task performance. Whereas SST neurons fired at low rates, both PV and VIP neurons fired at high rates both spontaneously and in response to whisker stimulation. After an initial outcome-invariant early sensory response, PV neurons had lower firing rates in hit trials compared to miss trials. Optogenetic inhibition of PV neurons during this time period enhanced behavioral performance. Hence, PV neuron activity might contribute causally to gating the sensorimotor transformation of a whisker sensory stimulus into licking motor output.},

The disruption of the BF has been linked with major neurological disorders, such as coma and Alzheimer's disease, as well as in normal cognitive aging. Although it is best known for its cholinergic neurons, the BF is in fact an anatomically and neurochemically complex structure. Recent studies using transgenic mouse lines to target specific BF cell types have led to a renaissance in the study of the BF and are beginning to yield new insights about cell-type-specific circuit mechanisms during behavior. These approaches enable us to determine the behavioral conditions under which cholinergic and noncholinergic BF neurons are activated and how they control cortical processing to influence behavior. Here we discuss recent advances that have expanded our knowledge about this poorly understood brain region and laid the foundation for future cell-type-specific manipulations to modulate arousal, attention, and cortical plasticity in neurological disorders. Although the basal forebrain is best known for, and often equated with, acetylcholine-containing neurons that provide most of the cholinergic innervation of the neocortex, it is in fact an anatomically and neurochemically complex structure. Recent studies using transgenic mouse lines to target specific cell types in the basal forebrain have led to a renaissance in this field and are beginning to dissect circuit mechanisms in the basal forebrain during behavior. This review discusses recent advances in the roles of basal forebrain cholinergic and noncholinergic neurons in cognition via their dynamic modulation of cortical activity.},

As well as preserving a physiological extracellular space, cryo fixation reveals larger numbers of docked synaptic vesicles, a smaller glial volume, and a less intimate glial coverage of synapses and blood vessels compared to chemical fixation.

Whisker sensory perception therefore requires integration of sensory and motor information, which occurs prominently in the neocortex. The signalling pathways from the neocortex for controlling whisker movements are currently poorly understood in mice. Here, we delineate two pathways, one originating from primary whisker somatosensory cortex (wS1) and the other from whisker motor cortex (wM1), that control qualitatively distinct movements of contralateral whiskers. Optogenetic stimulation of wS1 drove retraction of contralateral whiskers while stimulation of wM1 drove rhythmic whisker protraction. To map brainstem pathways connecting these cortical areas to whisker motor neurons, we used a combination of anterograde tracing using adenoassociated virus injected into neocortex and retrograde tracing using monosynaptic rabies virus injected into whisker muscles. Our data are consistent with wS1 driving whisker retraction by exciting glutamatergic premotor neurons in the rostral spinal trigeminal interpolaris nucleus, which in turn activate the motor neurons innervating the extrinsic retractor muscle nasolabialis. The rhythmic whisker protraction evoked by wM1 stimulation might be driven by excitation of excitatory and inhibitory premotor neurons in the brainstem reticular formation innervating both intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. Our data therefore begin to unravel the neuronal circuits linking the neocortex to whisker motor neurons.},

  abstract        = {The development of functional imaging techniques applicable to neuroscience and covering a wide range of spatial and temporal scales has greatly facilitated the exploration of the relationships between cognition, behaviour and electrical brain activity. For mammals, the neocortex plays a particularly profound role in generating sensory perception, controlling voluntary movement, higher cognitive functions and planning goal-directed behaviours. Since these remarkable functions of the neocortex cannot be explored in simple model preparations or in anesthetised animals, the neural basis of behaviour must be explored in awake behaving subjects. Because neocortical function is highly distributed across many rapidly interacting regions, it is essential to measure spatiotemporal dynamics of cortical activity in real-time. Extensive work in anesthetised mammals has shown that in vivo Voltage-Sensitive Dye Imaging (VSDI) reveals the neocortical population membrane potential dynamics at millisecond temporal resolution and subcolumnar spatial resolution. Here, we describe recent advances indicating that VSDI is also already well-developed for exploring cortical function in behaving monkeys and mice. The first animal model, the non-human primate, is well-suited for fundamental exploration of higher-level cognitive function and behavior. The second animal model, the mouse, benefits from a rich arsenal of molecular and genetic technologies. In the monkey, imaging from the same patch of cortex, repeatedly, is feasible for a long period of time, up to a year. In the rodent, VSDI is applicable to freely moving and awake head-restrained mice. Interactions between different cortical areas and different cortical columns can therefore now be dynamically mapped through VSDI and related to the corresponding behaviour. Thus by applying VSDI to mice and monkeys one can begin to explore how behaviour emerges from neuronal activity in neuronal networks residing in different cortical areas.},

Here we used two experimental data sets, a study of triplet connectivity statistics and a data set measuring neuronal responses to channelrhodopsin stimuli, to evaluate the fidelity of thousands of model networks. Network architectures comprised three neuron types (excitatory, fast spiking, and nonfast spiking inhibitory) and were created from a set of rules that govern the statistics of the resulting connection types. In a high-dimensional parameter scan, we varied the degree distributions (i.e., how many cells each neuron connects with) and the synaptic weight correlations of synapses from or onto the same neuron. These variations converted initially uniform random and homogeneously connected networks, in which every neuron sent and received equal numbers of synapses with equal synaptic strength distributions, to highly heterogeneous networks in which the number of synapses per neuron, as well as average synaptic strength of synapses from or to a neuron were variable. By evaluating the impact of each variable on the network structure and dynamics, and their similarity to the experimental data, we could falsify the uniform random sparse connectivity hypothesis for 7 of 36 connectivity parameters, but we also confirmed the hypothesis in 8 cases. Twenty-one parameters had no substantial impact on the results of the test protocols we used.},

Complex, distributed neural circuits therefore regulate whisker movement during behavior. This review focuses specifically on cortical whisker motor control. The whisker primary motor cortex (M1) strongly innervates brain stem reticular nuclei containing whisker premotor neurons, which might form a central pattern generator for rhythmic whisker protraction. In a parallel analogous pathway, the whisker primary somatosensory cortex (S1) strongly projects to the brain stem spinal trigeminal interpolaris nucleus, which contains whisker premotor neurons innervating muscles for whisker retraction. These anatomical pathways may play important functional roles, since stimulation of M1 drives exploratory rhythmic whisking, whereas stimulation of S1 drives whisker retraction.},

Here, we have combined optogenetic stimulation, whole cell recordings, and computational modeling to define key functional microcircuits within layer 2/3 of mouse primary somatosensory barrel cortex. In vitro optogenetic stimulation of excitatory layer 2/3 neurons expressing channelrhodopsin-2 evoked a rapid sequence of excitation followed by inhibition. Fast-spiking (FS) GABAergic neurons received large-amplitude, fast-rising depolarizing postsynaptic potentials, often driving action potentials. In contrast, the same optogenetic stimulus evoked small-amplitude, subthreshold postsynaptic potentials in excitatory and non-fast-spiking (NFS) GABAergic neurons. To understand the synaptic mechanisms underlying this network activity, we investigated unitary synaptic connectivity through multiple simultaneous whole cell recordings. FS GABAergic neurons received unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials with higher probability, larger amplitudes, and faster kinetics compared with NFS GABAergic neurons and other excitatory neurons. Both FS and NFS GABAergic neurons evoked robust inhibition on postsynaptic layer 2/3 neurons. A simple computational model based on the experimentally determined electrophysiological properties of the different classes of layer 2/3 neurons and their unitary synaptic connectivity accounted for key aspects of the network activity evoked by optogenetic stimulation, including the strong recruitment of FS GABAergic neurons acting to suppress firing of excitatory neurons. We conclude that FS GABAergic neurons play an important role in neocortical microcircuit function through their strong local synaptic connectivity, which might contribute to driving sparse coding in excitatory layer 2/3 neurons of mouse barrel cortex in vivo.},

  abstract        = {Cortical information processing originates from the exchange of action potentials between many cell types. To capture the essence of these interactions, it is of critical importance to build mathematical models that reflect the characteristic features of spike generation in individual neurons. We propose a framework to automatically extract such features from current-clamp experiments, in particular the passive properties of a neuron (i.e., membrane time constant, reversal potential, and capacitance), the spike-triggered adaptation currents, as well as the dynamics of the action potential threshold. The stochastic model that results from our maximum likelihood approach accurately predicts the spike times, the subthreshold voltage, the firing patterns, and the type of frequency-current curve. Extracting the model parameters for three cortical cell types revealed that cell types show highly significant differences in the time course of the spike-triggered currents and moving threshold, that is, in their adaptation and refractory properties but not in their passive properties. In particular, GABAergic fast-spiking neurons mediate weak adaptation through spike-triggered currents only, whereas regular spiking excitatory neurons mediate adaptation with both moving threshold and spike-triggered currents. GABAergic nonfast-spiking neurons combine the two distinct adaptation mechanisms with reduced strength. Differences between cell types are large enough to enable automatic classification of neurons into three different classes. Parameter extraction is performed for individual neurons so that we find not only the mean parameter values for each neuron type but also the spread of parameters within a group of neurons, which will be useful for future large-scale computer simulations.},

  abstract        = {Although the physiological demands of cricket match play are emerging, the demands of contemporary training practices have not been reported. The aim of this study was to quantify the physiological demands of selected cricket training activities and compare these to known match demands. Twenty-eight different training activities were monitored in national academy level cricketers (n = 42) using global positioning system units during a 14-week residential training program. The training activities were classified into 3 categories: conditioning sessions (n = 8), skill sessions (n = 9), and game simulations (n = 11). Conditioning sessions were further classified into high- (n = 4) and low- (n = 4) intensity drills. Time-motion measures included movement patterns (walk, jog, run, stride, and sprint distances), total distance covered, number of sprints, number of high-intensity efforts, maximum speed, and recovery time between high-intensity efforts. Inferential statistics were used to quantify magnitudes of difference between various training drills. Movement patterns were then compared to recently published game data (Twenty20, One-Day, and Multiday games) from the same sample group of cricketers. Conditioning drills were twice as long in duration as skill drills and twice as intense as both the skill and game simulation drills. Exercising heart rates were 9-26% and lactate levels up to 3.5 times higher in conditioning compared to other training drills. Conditioning drills matched or exceeded (up to 10 b·min⁻¹; 5%) peak game heart rates. Conversely, skill and simulation drills replicated mean game heart rates for some, but not all positions. In conclusion, training replicates or exceeds cricket match demands in conditioning-type drills but not in simulation or skill-based drills. Modification of skill and simulation training drill practices will ensure closer replication of match and training demands.},

Differences in player movement patterns between 2 game formats (1 day and multiday) and 2 levels of elite performance (state and international) were quantified with global positioning system technology. Five movement categories were established, and 15 movement pattern variables were reported. Data from state (n = 42, 200 files) and international (n = 12, 63 files) cricketers were scaled to hourly values to compare movement demands. Cricketers generally covered similar distances in both formats, except for state 1-day fielders who covered moderately greater distance (~0.7 km·h⁻¹ more; 21 ± 8%; mean ± 90% confidence interval) than state multiday (first-class) fielders. State 1-day cricketers also covered small to moderately greater distances (running 41 ± 13%; striding 38 ± 16%; sprinting 39 ± 36%) in the faster movement patterns and consequently had moderately less recovery time (13-67%) between high-intensity efforts as first-class cricketers. Comparisons of movements between performance levels revealed similar total distances between state and international cricketers. However, Test fielders covered moderately greater (29-48%) distances at the higher-intensity movement patterns (running, striding, and sprinting) than first-class fielders. In summary, although movement patterns were broadly similar between formats and levels, it appears that one day cricket (compared with multiday games) and test matches (compared with state-level competition) require more higher-intensity running. Conditioning coaches should train state and international 1-day cricket players similarly, but should account for the higher physical demands of international multiday cricket.},

We examined the effect of a short 4-d hot/humid acclimation program on classical physiological indicators of heat acclimation. Male club cricketers were randomly assigned into heat acclimation (ACC, n = 6) or control (CON, n = 6) groups, and 30 min treadmill trials (10 km/h, approx. 30 ± 1.0°C, approx. 65 ± 6% RH) were conducted at baseline and postacclimation. The ACC group completed four high intensity (30-45 min) acclimation sessions on consecutive days at approx. 30°C and approx. 60% RH using a cycle ergometer. The CON group completed matched cycle training in moderate conditions (approx. 20°C, approx. 60% RH). Physiological measures during each treadmill trial included heart rate; core and skin temperatures; sweat Na+, K+ and Cl- electrolyte concentrations; and sweat rate. After the 4-d intervention, the ACC group had a moderate decrease of -11 (3 to -24 beats/min; mean and 90% CI) in the 30 min heart rate, and moderate to large reductions in electrolyte concentrations: Na+ -18% (-4 to -31%), K+ -15% (0 to -27%), Cl- -22% (-9 to -33%). Both ACC and CON groups had only trivial changes in core and skin temperatures and sweat rate. After the intervention, both groups perceived they were more comfortable exercising in the heat. The 4-d heat intervention had no detrimental effect on performance. Four 30-45 min high intensity cycle sessions in hot/humid conditions elicited partial heat acclimation. For full heat acclimation a more intensive and extensive (and modality-specific) acclimation intervention is needed for cricket players.},

Here we review and contrast models of these two mechanisms, and then show that both phenomena can co-exist within a unified system in which neurons hold information in both activity and synapses. Rapid plasticity in flexibly-coding neurons allows features to be bound together into objects, with an important emergent property being the focus of attention. One memory item is held by persistent activity in an attended or "focused" state, and is thus remembered better than other items. Other, previously attended items can remain in memory but in the background, encoded in activity-silent synaptic traces. This dual functional architecture provides a unified common mechanism accounting for a diversity of perplexing attention and memory effects that have been hitherto difficult to explain in a single theoretical framework.},

Here we introduce a theoretical framework in which long-term plasticity performs an optimization of the postsynaptic response statistics toward a given mean with minimal variance. Consequently, the state of the synapse at the time of plasticity induction determines the ratio of pre- and postsynaptic modifications. Our theory explains the experimentally observed expression loci of the hippocampal and neocortical synaptic potentiation studies we examined. Moreover, the theory predicts presynaptic expression of long-term depression, consistent with experimental observations. At inhibitory synapses, the theory suggests a statistically efficient excitatory-inhibitory balance in which changes in inhibitory postsynaptic response statistics specifically target the mean excitation. Our results provide a unifying theory for understanding the expression mechanisms and functions of long-term synaptic transmission plasticity.},

  abstract        = {Nervous systems use excitatory cell assemblies to encode and represent sensory percepts. Similarly, synaptically connected cell assemblies or "engrams" are thought to represent memories of past experience. Multiple lines of recent evidence indicate that brain systems create and use inhibitory replicas of excitatory representations for important cognitive functions. Such matched "inhibitory engrams" can form through homeostatic potentiation of inhibition onto postsynaptic cells that show increased levels of excitation. Inhibitory engrams can reduce behavioral responses to familiar stimuli, thereby resulting in behavioral habituation. In addition, by preventing inappropriate activation of excitatory memory engrams, inhibitory engrams can make memories quiescent, stored in a latent form that is available for context-relevant activation. In neural networks with balanced excitatory and inhibitory engrams, the release of innate responses and recall of associative memories can occur through focused disinhibition. Understanding mechanisms that regulate the formation and expression of inhibitory engrams in vivo may help not only to explain key features of cognition but also to provide insight into transdiagnostic traits associated with psychiatric conditions such as autism, schizophrenia, and posttraumatic stress disorder.},

  abstract        = {Most excitatory inputs in the mammalian brain are made on dendritic spines, rather than on dendritic shafts. Spines compartmentalize calcium, and this biochemical isolation can underlie input-specific synaptic plasticity, providing a raison d'etre for spines. However, recent results indicate that the spine can experience a membrane potential different from that in the parent dendrite, as though the spine neck electrically isolated the spine. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging of mouse neocortical pyramidal neurons to analyze the correlation between the morphologies of spines activated under minimal synaptic stimulation and the excitatory postsynaptic potentials they generate. We find that excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitudes are inversely correlated with spine neck lengths. Furthermore, a spike timing-dependent plasticity protocol, in which two-photon glutamate uncaging over a spine is paired with postsynaptic spikes, produces rapid shrinkage of the spine neck and concomitant increases in the amplitude of the evoked spine potentials. Using numerical simulations, we explore the parameter regimes for the spine neck resistance and synaptic conductance changes necessary to explain our observations. Our data, directly correlating synaptic and morphological plasticity, imply that long-necked spines have small or negligible somatic voltage contributions, but that, upon synaptic stimulation paired with postsynaptic activity, they can shorten their necks and increase synaptic efficacy, thus changing the input/output gain of pyramidal neurons.},

  abstract        = {Chandelier (axoaxonic) cells (ChCs) are a distinct group of GABAergic interneurons that innervate the axon initial segments of pyramidal cells. However, their circuit role and the function of their clearly defined anatomical specificity remain unclear. Recent work has demonstrated that chandelier cells can produce depolarizing GABAergic PSPs, occasionally driving postsynaptic targets to spike. On the other hand, other work suggests that ChCs are hyperpolarizing and may have an inhibitory role. These disparate functional effects may reflect heterogeneity among ChCs. Here, using brain slices from transgenic mouse strains, we first demonstrate that, across different neocortical areas and genetic backgrounds, upper Layer 2/3 ChCs belong to a single electrophysiologically and morphologically defined population, extensively sampling Layer 1 inputs with asymmetric dendrites. Consistent with being a single cell type, we find electrical coupling between ChCs. We then investigate the effect of chandelier cell activation on pyramidal neuron spiking in several conditions, ranging from the resting membrane potential to stimuli designed to approximate in vivo membrane potential dynamics. We find that under quiescent conditions, chandelier cells are capable of both promoting and inhibiting spike generation, depending on the postsynaptic membrane potential. However, during in vivo-like membrane potential fluctuations, the dominant postsynaptic effect was a strong inhibition. Thus, neocortical chandelier cells, even from within a homogeneous population, appear to play a dual role in the circuit, helping to activate quiescent pyramidal neurons, while at the same time inhibiting active ones.},

Here we introduce an idea for the gating of multiple signals in cortical networks that combines principles of signal propagation with aspects of balanced networks. Specifically, we studied networks in which incoming excitatory signals are normally cancelled by locally evoked inhibition, leaving the targeted layer unresponsive. Transmission can be gated 'on' by modulating excitatory and inhibitory gains to upset this detailed balance. We illustrate gating through detailed balance in large networks of integrate-and-fire neurons. We show successful gating of multiple signals and study failure modes that produce effects reminiscent of clinically observed pathologies. Provided that the individual signals are detectable, detailed balance has a large capacity for gating multiple signals.},

  abstract        = {Transmission of signals within the brain is essential for cognitive function, but it is not clear how neural circuits support reliable and accurate signal propagation over a sufficiently large dynamic range. Two modes of propagation have been studied: synfire chains, in which synchronous activity travels through feedforward layers of a neuronal network, and the propagation of fluctuations in firing rate across these layers. In both cases, a sufficient amount of noise, which was added to previous models from an external source, had to be included to support stable propagation. Sparse, randomly connected networks of spiking model neurons can generate chaotic patterns of activity. We investigate whether this activity, which is a more realistic noise source, is sufficient to allow for signal transmission. We find that, for rate-coded signals but not for synfire chains, such networks support robust and accurate signal reproduction through up to six layers if appropriate adjustments are made in synaptic strengths. We investigate the factors affecting transmission and show that multiple signals can propagate simultaneously along different pathways. Using this feature, we show how different types of logic gates can arise within the architecture of the random network through the strengthening of specific synapses.},

We compared evoked cortical activity in mice expressing three ChR variants with distinct temporal profiles under the CamKII promoter: Chronos, Chrimson, and ChR2. We assessed overall neural activation by measuring the amplitude and temporal progression of evoked spiking. Using γ-range (30-80 Hz) local field potential (LFP) power as an assay for local network engagement, we examined the recruitment of cortical network activity by each tool. All variants caused light-evoked increases in firing  , but each demonstrated different temporal patterning of evoked activity. In addition, the three ChRs had distinct effects on cortical γ-band activity. Our findings suggest the properties of optogenetic tools can substantially affect their efficacy  , as well their engagement of circuit resonance.},

  abstract        = {Cortical networks receive a highly variable stream of inputs from internal and external influences, and must flexibly adapt their operations on a short timescale. Recent work has highlighted this state-dependent functional flexibility of cortical circuits and provided initial insights into underlying circuit-level mechanisms. Transitions from quiescent to aroused or task-engaged behavioral states are associated with common motifs of network activity, including changes in correlations and enhanced sensory encoding. Evidence points to a key role for selective activation of specific GABAergic interneuron populations in mediating mode-switching in cortical networks. Finally, inhibitory interneurons may function as a critical target for convergent state-dependent neuromodulatory sculpting of cortical circuits.},

  abstract        = {Recent work suggests an important role for cortical-subcortical networks in seizure-related loss of consciousness. Temporal lobe seizures disrupt subcortical arousal systems, which may lead to depressed cortical function and loss of consciousness. Extracellular recordings show ictal neocortical slow waves at about 1 Hz, but it is not known whether these simply represent seizure propagation or alternatively deep sleep-like activity, which should include cortical neuronal Up and Down states. In this study, using in vivo whole-cell recordings in a rat model of focal limbic seizures, we directly examine the electrophysiological properties of cortical neurons during seizures and deep anesthesia. We found that during seizures, the membrane potential of frontal cortical secondary motor cortex layer 5 neurons fluctuates between Up and Down states, with decreased input resistance and increased firing rate in Up states when compared to Down states. Importantly, Up and Down states in seizures are not significantly different from those in deep anesthesia, in terms of membrane potential, oscillation frequency, firing rate, and input resistance. By demonstrating these fundamental similarities in cortical electrophysiology between deep anesthesia and seizures, our results support the idea that a state of decreased cortical arousal may contribute to mechanisms of loss of consciousness during seizures.},

Furthermore, the diversity of inhibitory interneuron populations poses a challenge for understanding local circuit interactions during seizure initiation. Using a combined optogenetic and electrophysiological approach, we examined the activity of identified mouse hippocampal interneuron classes during chemoconvulsant seizure induction in vivo. Surprisingly, synaptic inhibition from parvalbumin- (PV) and somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons remained intact throughout the preictal period and early ictal phase. However, these two sources of inhibition exhibited cell-type-specific differences in their preictal firing patterns and sensitivity to input. Our findings suggest that the onset of ictal activity is not associated with loss of firing by these interneurons or a failure of synaptic inhibition but is instead linked with disruptions of the respective roles these interneurons play in the hippocampal circuit.},

GABAergic activity is crucial not only for entrainment of oscillatory activity across a neural population, but also for precise regulation of the timing of action potentials and the suppression of slow-timescale correlations. The diversity of inhibition provides the potential for flexible regulation of patterned activity, but also poses a challenge to identifying the elements of excitatory-inhibitory interactions underlying network engagement. This review highlights the key roles of inhibitory interneurons in spike correlations and brain rhythms, describes several scales on which GABAergic inhibition regulates timing in neural networks, and identifies potential consequences of inhibitory dysfunction.},

We performed conditional ablation of the TrkB receptor in parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons to study whether postnatal loss of TrkB in parvalbumin cells affects their survival, connectivity, spontaneous and evoked neuronal activity and behavior. Using in vivo recordings of local field potentials, we found reduced gamma oscillations in the sensory cortex of PVcre+; TrkBF/F conditional knockout mice (TrkB cKO), along with increased firing of putative excitatory neurons. There was a significant downregulation in parvalbumin neuron number in cerebral and cerebellar cortices of TrkB cKO mice. In addition, inhibitory synaptic connections between basket cells and pyramidal neurons were profoundly reduced in the neocortex of TrkB cKO mice and there was a loss of cortical volume. TrkB cKO mice also showed profound hyperactivity, stereotypies, motor deficits and learning/memory defects. Our findings demonstrate that the targeting and/or synapse formation of PV-expressing basket cells with principal excitatory neurons require TrkB signaling in parvalbumin cells. Disruption of this signaling has major consequences for parvalbumin interneuron connectivity, network dynamics, cognitive and motor behavior.},

In addition, the participation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the γ rhythm varies across local circuits and conditions, particularly in the cortex. Although these dynamics present a challenge to interpreting the functional role of γ oscillations, these patterns of activity emerge from synaptic interactions among excitatory and inhibitory neurons and thus provide important insight into local circuit operations.},

Although there is overlap across the groups, on average, corticotectal (CT) cells exhibit lower contrast thresholds and broader tuning for orientation and spatial frequency in comparison to corticostriatal (CS) cells, whereas corticocortical (CC) cells have intermediate properties. Noise correlational analyses support the hypothesis that CT cells integrate information across diverse layer 5 populations, whereas CS and CC cells form more selectively interconnected groups. Overall, our findings demonstrate the existence of functional subnetworks within layer 5 that may differentially route visual information to behaviorally relevant downstream targets.},

Recent work suggests that the mechanism for depressed cortical function during focal seizures may depend on decreased subcortical cholinergic arousal, which leads to a sleep-like state of cortical slow-wave activity. To test this hypothesis, we sought to directly activate subcortical cholinergic neurons during focal limbic seizures to determine the effects on cortical function. Here we used an optogenetic approach to selectively stimulate cholinergic brainstem neurons in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus during focal limbic seizures induced in a lightly anesthetized rat model. We found an increase in cortical gamma activity and a decrease in delta activity in response to cholinergic stimulation. These findings support the mechanistic role of reduced subcortical cholinergic arousal in causing cortical dysfunction during seizures. Through further work, electrical or optogenetic stimulation of subcortical arousal networks may ultimately lead to new treatments aimed at preventing cortical dysfunction during seizures.},

  abstract        = {Aquatic treadmill (ATM) running may simultaneously promote aerobic fitness and enhance muscle growth when combined with resistance training (RT) compared with land-treadmill (LTM) running. Therefore, we examined acute and chronic physiological responses to RT, concurrent RT-LTM, and concurrent RT-ATM. Forty-seven untrained volunteers (men: n = 23, 37 ± 11 yr, 29.6 ± 4.6 kg/m(2); women: n = 24, 38 ± 12 yr, 27.53 ± 6.4 kg/m(2)) from the general population were tested for V̇o2max, body composition, and strength before and after training. All groups performed 12 wk of RT (2 wk, 3 × 8-12 sets at 60 to approximately 80% 1-repetition maximum). The RT-LTM and RT-ATM groups also performed 12 wk of LTM or ATM training (2 wk immediately post-RT and 1 wk in isolation, 60-85% V̇o2max, 250-500 kcal/session). Additionally, 25 subjects volunteered for muscle biopsy prior to and 24 h post-acute exercise before and after training. Stable isotope labeling (70% (2)H2O, 3 ml/kg) was utilized to quantify 24 h post-exercise myofibrillar fractional synthesis rates (myoFSR). Mixed-model ANOVA revealed that RT-ATM but not RT-LTM training produced greater chronic increases in lean mass than RT alone (P < 0.05). RT-LTM training was found to elicit the greatest decreases in percent body fat (-2.79%, P < 0.05). In the untrained state, acute RT-ATM exercise elicited higher 24-h myoFSRs compared with RT (+5.68%/day, P < 0.01) and RT-LTM (+4.08%/day, P < 0.05). Concurrent RT-ATM exercise and training elicit greater skeletal muscle anabolism than RT alone or RT-LTM.},

  abstract        = {Local cortical circuit activity in vivo comprises a complex and flexible series of interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Our understanding of the functional interactions between these different neural populations has been limited by the difficulty of identifying and selectively manipulating the diverse and sparsely represented inhibitory interneuron classes in the intact brain. The integration of recently developed optical tools with traditional electrophysiological techniques provides a powerful window into the role of inhibition in regulating the activity of excitatory neurons. In particular, optogenetic targeting of specific cell classes reveals the distinct impacts of local inhibitory populations on other neurons in the surrounding local network. In addition to providing the ability to activate or suppress spiking in target cells, optogenetic activation identifies extracellularly recorded neurons by class, even when naturally occurring spike rates are extremely low. However, there are several important limitations on the use of these tools and the interpretation of resulting data. The purpose of this article is to outline the uses and limitations of optogenetic tools, along with current methods for achieving cell type-specific expression, and to highlight the advantages of an experimental approach combining optogenetics and electrophysiology to explore the role of inhibition in active networks. To illustrate the efficacy of these combined approaches, I present data comparing targeted manipulations of cortical fast-spiking, parvalbumin-expressing and low threshold-spiking, somatostatin-expressing interneurons in vivo.},

In contrast, drive to regular-spiking (RS) pyramidal cells enhances power at lower frequencies, with a peak at 8 Hz. The first result is consistent with previous computational studies emphasizing the role of FS and the time constant of GABA(A) synaptic inhibition in gamma rhythmicity. However, the same theoretical models do not typically predict low-frequency LFP enhancement with RS drive. To develop hypotheses as to how the same network can support these contrasting behaviors, we constructed a biophysically principled network model of primary somatosensory neocortex containing FS, RS, and low-threshold spiking (LTS) INs. Cells were modeled with detailed cell anatomy and physiology, multiple dendritic compartments, and included active somatic and dendritic ionic currents. Consistent with prior studies, the model demonstrated gamma resonance during FS drive, dependent on the time constant of GABA(A) inhibition induced by synchronous FS activity. Lower-frequency enhancement during RS drive was replicated only on inclusion of an inhibitory LTS population, whose activation was critically dependent on RS synchrony and evoked longer-lasting inhibition. Our results predict that differential recruitment of FS and LTS inhibitory populations is essential to the observed cortical dynamics and may provide a means for amplifying the natural expression of distinct oscillations in normal cortical processing.},

Here we identify cellular mechanisms underlying the sensitivity of cortical neurons to the timing of sensory-evoked synaptic inputs. We find that temporally coincident inputs to layer 4 neurons in primary visual cortex evoke an increase in spike precision and supralinear spike summation. Underlying this nonlinear summation are changes in the evoked excitatory conductance and the associated membrane potential response, and a lengthening of the window between excitation and inhibition. Furthermore, fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons in layer 4 exhibit a shorter window of temporal sensitivity compared with excitatory neurons. In contrast to the enhanced response to synchronous inputs by layer 4 neurons, sensory input integration in downstream cortical layers is more linear and less sensitive to timing. Neurons in the input layer of cortex are thus uniquely optimized to detect and encode synchronous sensory-evoked inputs.},

Current theory predicts that gamma oscillations are generated by synchronous activity of fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons, with the resulting rhythmic inhibition producing neural ensemble synchrony by generating a narrow window for effective excitation. We causally tested these hypotheses in barrel cortex in vivo by targeting optogenetic manipulation selectively to fast-spiking interneurons. Here we show that light-driven activation of fast-spiking interneurons at varied frequencies (8-200 Hz) selectively amplifies gamma oscillations. In contrast, pyramidal neuron activation amplifies only lower frequency oscillations, a cell-type-specific double dissociation. We found that the timing of a sensory input relative to a gamma cycle determined the amplitude and precision of evoked responses. Our data directly support the fast-spiking-gamma hypothesis and provide the first causal evidence that distinct network activity states can be induced in vivo by cell-type-specific activation.},

Application of pinacidil induced vasodilation and increased blood volume in the in vivo neocortex in anesthetized rats and awake mice. Direct application of this agent to the in vitro neocortical slice had no direct impact on biophysical properties of neurons or astrocytes assessed with whole-cell recording. These findings suggest that pinacidil provides an effective and selective means for inducing hyperemia in vivo, and may provide a useful tool in directly testing the impact of hemodynamics on neural activity, as recently predicted by the hemo-neural hypothesis.},

  abstract        = {Although several lines of evidence suggest that stimulus selectivity in somatosensory and visual cortices is critically dependent on unselective inhibition, particularly in the thalamorecipient layer 4, no comprehensive comparison of the responses of excitatory and inhibitory cells has been conducted. Here, we recorded intracellularly from a large population of regular spiking (RS; presumed excitatory) and fast spiking (FS; presumed inhibitory) cells in layers 2-6 of primary visual cortex. In layer 4, where selectivity for orientation and spatial frequency first emerges, we found no untuned FS cells. Instead, the tuning of the spike output of layer 4 FS cells was significantly but moderately broader than that of RS cells. However, the tuning of the underlying synaptic responses was not different, indicating that the difference in spike-output selectivity resulted from differences in the transformation of synaptic input into firing rate. Layer 4 FS cells exhibited significantly lower input resistance and faster time constants than layer 4 RS cells, leading to larger and faster membrane potential (V(m)) fluctuations. FS cell V(m) fluctuations were more broadly tuned than those of RS cells and matched spike-output tuning, suggesting that the broader spike tuning of these cells was driven by visually evoked synaptic noise. These differences were not observed outside of layer 4. Thus, cell type-specific differences in stimulus feature selectivity at the first level of cortical sensory processing may arise as a result of distinct biophysical properties that determine the dynamics of synaptic integration.},

  abstract        = {Oscillatory activity is generated by many neural systems. gamma band (approximately 40 Hz) oscillations in the thalamus and cortex occur spontaneously and in response to sensory stimuli. Fast rhythmic bursting (FRB) cells (also called chattering cells) comprise a unique class of cortical neurons that, during depolarization by current injection, intrinsically generate bursts of high-frequency action potentials with an interburst frequency between 30 and 50 Hz. In the present study, we show for the first time that FRB cells in the primary visual cortex can be either simple or complex and are distributed throughout all cortical layers. Strikingly, both simple and complex FRB cells generate spike bursts at gamma frequencies in response to depolarizing current pulses, but only simple FRB cells exhibit a selective, stimulus feature-dependent increase in gamma oscillations in response to visual stimulation. In addition, we find that hyperpolarization does not reduce the relative power of visually evoked gamma oscillations in the V(m) response of FRB cells. Our results thus indicate that visually evoked gamma activity in individual simple and complex FRB cells is generated in large part by rhythmic synaptic input, rather than by depolarization-dependent activation of intrinsic properties. Finally, the presence of FRB cells in layer 6 suggests a role for corticothalamic feedback in potentiating thalamic oscillations and facilitating the generation of a corticothalamocortical oscillatory loop. We propose that rather than functioning as pacemakers, FRB cells amplify and distribute stimulus-driven gamma oscillations in the neocortex.},

In particular, it is unknown whether input from the forebrain nucleus interface of the nidopallium (NIf), which exhibits both sensory and premotor activity, is necessary for both auditory and premotor processing in its target, HVC. Here we show that bilateral NIf lesions result in long-term loss of HVC auditory activity but do not impair song production. NIf is thus a major source of auditory input to HVC, but an intact NIf is not necessary for motor output in adult zebra finches.},

In this study, we take advantage of the discrete, feedforward organization of the avian song system to identify a site and mechanism of NE action underlying state-dependent modulation of sensory processing. We have developed an experimental paradigm in which brief arousal repeatedly suppresses song system auditory responsiveness. Using pharmacological manipulations in vivo, we show that infusion of alpha-adrenergic antagonists into the NIf (nucleus interfacialis of the nidopallium), an auditory forebrain area, blocks this state-dependent modulation. We also demonstrate dose-dependent enhancement and suppression of song system auditory response properties by NE and adrenergic agonists. Our results demonstrate that noradrenergic release in a single forebrain area is a mechanism underlying behavioral state-dependent regulation of auditory processing in a neural system specialized for vocal learning.},

Modulation is not observed in the primary thalamo-recipient auditory area Field L, the indirect source of auditory input to HVC. In this study, we show that auditory responsiveness in nucleus interfacialis (NIf), the immediate auditory afferent to HVC, is modulated by behavioral state. While auditory responsiveness is generally greater in NIf during wakefulness and in HVC during sedation, simultaneous recordings reveal a co-variation of auditory response magnitude. This co-variation is observed both in awake birds, where responses are spontaneously variable, and in sedated birds during manipulations of arousal levels. Auditory responses in NIf and HVC, which are selective for the bird's own song (BOS) during sedation, become predominantly unselective during wakefulness. This loss of selectivity is accompanied by a decrease in the similarity of NIf and HVC response patterns. To explore the role of NIf in shaping HVC auditory responses, we pharmacologically manipulated NIf while recording in HVC. Injection of the GABA(A) agonist muscimol into NIf eliminated most spontaneous activity and all auditory responses in the ipsilateral HVC, while injections of the GABA(A) antagonist bicuculline increased HVC auditory responsiveness and selectivity. These findings indicate that HVC is not the initial site of behavioral state-dependent modulation in the song system. Together with the suppression of HVC auditory responses by muscimol in NIf, these results suggest that NIf plays an important role in the flow of auditory information to HVC.},

We present evidence from recordings in awake, anesthetized, and sleeping male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) that auditory responsiveness in nucleus HVc is profoundly affected by changes in behavioral state. In anesthetized and sleeping birds, auditory responses were characterized by an increase in firing rate that was selective for the bird's own song (BOS) and highly stable over time. In contrast, HVc responses during wakefulness were extremely variable and transitioned between undetectable and robust levels over short intervals. Surprisingly, auditory responses in awake birds were not selective for the BOS stimulus. The variability of HVc auditory responses in awake birds suggests that, as in mammals, wakefulness is not a uniform behavioral state. Rather, auditory responsiveness likely is continually influenced by variables such as arousal state. We therefore developed several experimental paradigms in which we could manipulate arousal levels during auditory stimulus presentation. In all cases, arousal suppressed HVc auditory responses. This effect was specific to the song system, as auditory responses in Field L, a primary auditory area that is a source of auditory input to HVc, were unaffected. While arousal acts as a negative regulator of HVc auditory responsiveness, the presence and variability of the responses observed in awake, alert birds suggests that other mechanisms, such as attention, may enhance auditory responsiveness. The interplay between behavioral state and sensory processing may regulate song system responsiveness according to the bird's behavioral and social context.},

  abstract     = {Beer's law assumes a linear dependence of absorbance on concentration, accordingly the index of absorption and the molar attenuation coefficient are material properties and the absorption cross section, including absorbance itself, must be additive if chemical interactions are excluded. Under the "no interaction" condition, a linear dependence should also exist between macroscopic polarization and the number of induced dipole moments per unit volume. The latter linear dependence is the basis for dispersion theory. Invoking Maxwell's wave equation, Beer's law has been derived recently from dispersion theory. As a result, Beer's law is a limiting law. Accordingly, indices of absorption and molar attenuation coefficients including absorption cross sections are no material properties and the latter can per se not be additive. Indeed, as we show in this contribution, not even for particles very small compared to wavelength, where the scattering cross sections can be neglected, is this additivity a given, except for comparably large distances between the particles. We investigate the magnitude of these critical distances with the help of finite difference time domain calculations for amorphous SiO2 spheres in the infrared spectral range. Based on electric field maps, we conclude that the deviations scale with oscillator strengths and, correspondingly, with local electric fields and nearfield effects.},

Learning increased selectivity for task-relevant stimuli of PYR, PV and SOM subsets but not VIP cells. Strikingly, PV neurons became as selective as PYR cells, and their functional interactions reorganized, leading to the emergence of stimulus-selective PYR-PV ensembles. Conversely, SOM activity became strongly decorrelated from the network, and PYR-SOM coupling before learning predicted selectivity increases in individual PYR cells. Thus, learning differentially shapes the activity and interactions of multiple cell classes: while SOM inhibition may gate selectivity changes, PV interneurons become recruited into stimulus-specific ensembles and provide more selective inhibition as the network becomes better at discriminating behaviorally relevant stimuli.},

Dispersion analysis is exemplary performed on two different crystals, which show different spectral features and different levels of difficulties to evaluate.

  abstract        = {How a sensory stimulus is processed and perceived depends on the surrounding sensory scene. In the visual cortex, contextual signals can be conveyed by an extensive network of intra- and inter-areal excitatory connections that link neurons representing stimulus features separated in visual space. However, the connectional logic of visual contextual inputs remains unknown; it is not clear what information individual neurons receive from different parts of the visual field, nor how this input relates to the visual features that a neuron encodes, defined by its spatial receptive field. Here we determine the organization of excitatory synaptic inputs responding to different locations in the visual scene by mapping spatial receptive fields in dendritic spines of mouse visual cortex neurons using two-photon calcium imaging. We find that neurons receive functionally diverse inputs from extended regions of visual space. Inputs representing similar visual features from the same location in visual space are more likely to cluster on neighbouring spines. Inputs from visual field regions beyond the receptive field of the postsynaptic neuron often synapse on higher-order dendritic branches. These putative long-range inputs are more frequent and more likely to share the preference for oriented edges with the postsynaptic neuron when the receptive field of the input is spatially displaced along the axis of the receptive field orientation of the postsynaptic neuron. Therefore, the connectivity between neurons with displaced receptive fields obeys a specific rule, whereby they connect preferentially when their receptive fields are co-oriented and co-axially aligned. This organization of synaptic connectivity is ideally suited for the amplification of elongated edges, which are enriched in the visual environment, and thus provides a potential substrate for contour integration and object grouping.},

  abstract        = {Accurate estimation of neuronal receptive fields is essential for understanding sensory processing in the early visual system. Yet a full characterization of receptive fields is still incomplete, especially with regard to natural visual stimuli and in complete populations of cortical neurons. While previous work has incorporated known structural properties of the early visual system, such as lateral connectivity, or imposing simple-cell-like receptive field structure, no study has exploited the fact that nearby V1 neurons share common feed-forward input from thalamus and other upstream cortical neurons. We introduce a new method for estimating receptive fields simultaneously for a population of V1 neurons, using a model-based analysis incorporating knowledge of the feed-forward visual hierarchy. We assume that a population of V1 neurons shares a common pool of thalamic inputs, and consists of two layers of simple and complex-like V1 neurons. When fit to recordings of a local population of mouse layer 2/3 V1 neurons, our model offers an accurate description of their response to natural images and significant improvement of prediction power over the current state-of-the-art methods. We show that the responses of a large local population of V1 neurons with locally diverse receptive fields can be described with surprisingly limited number of thalamic inputs, consistent with recent experimental findings. Our structural model not only offers an improved functional characterization of V1 neurons, but also provides a framework for studying the relationship between connectivity and function in visual cortical areas.},

However, higher order thalamic nuclei, such as the pulvinar, interconnect with many cortical and subcortical areas, suggesting a role for the thalamus in providing sensory and behavioral context. Yet the nature of the signals conveyed to cortex by higher order thalamus remains poorly understood. Here we use axonal calcium imaging to measure information provided to visual cortex by the pulvinar equivalent in mice, the lateral posterior nucleus (LP), as well as the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). We found that dLGN conveys retinotopically precise visual signals, while LP provides distributed information from the visual scene. Both LP and dLGN projections carry locomotion signals. However, while dLGN inputs often respond to positive combinations of running and visual flow speed, LP signals discrepancies between self-generated and external visual motion. This higher order thalamic nucleus therefore conveys diverse contextual signals that inform visual cortex about visual scene changes not predicted by the animal's own actions.},

Although this highly skewed distribution of connection strengths is observed in diverse cortical areas, its functional significance remains unknown: it is not clear how connection strength relates to neuronal response properties, nor how strong and weak inputs contribute to information processing in local microcircuits. Here we reveal that the strength of connections between layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) obeys a simple rule--the few strong connections occur between neurons with most correlated responses, while only weak connections link neurons with uncorrelated responses. Moreover, we show that strong and reciprocal connections occur between cells with similar spatial receptive field structure. Although weak connections far outnumber strong connections, each neuron receives the majority of its local excitation from a small number of strong inputs provided by the few neurons with similar responses to visual features. By dominating recurrent excitation, these infrequent yet powerful inputs disproportionately contribute to feature preference and selectivity. Therefore, our results show that the apparently complex organization of excitatory connection strength reflects the similarity of neuronal responses, and suggest that rare, strong connections mediate stimulus-specific response amplification in cortical microcircuits.},

It remains unknown whether visual experience is required for the developmental refinement of intracortical circuitry or whether this maturation is guided intrinsically. Here, we correlated the connectivity between V1 L2/3 neurons assayed by simultaneous whole-cell recordings in vitro to their response properties measured by two-photon calcium imaging in vivo in dark-reared mice. We found that neurons with similar responses to oriented gratings or natural movies became preferentially connected in the absence of visual experience. However, the relationship between connectivity and similarity of visual responses to natural movies was not as strong in dark-reared as in normally reared mice. Moreover, dark rearing prevented the normally occurring loss of connections between visually nonresponsive neurons after eye opening (Ko et al., 2013). Therefore, our data suggest that the absence of visual input does not prevent the emergence of functionally specific recurrent connectivity in cortical circuits; however, visual experience is required for complete microcircuit maturation.},

However, the developmental mechanisms underlying the formation of functionally organized connectivity in cortical microcircuits remain unknown. Here we directly relate patterns of excitatory synaptic connectivity to visual response properties of neighbouring layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in mouse visual cortex at different postnatal ages, using two-photon calcium imaging in vivo and multiple whole-cell recordings in vitro. Although neural responses were already highly selective for visual stimuli at eye opening, neurons responding to similar visual features were not yet preferentially connected, indicating that the emergence of feature selectivity does not depend on the precise arrangement of local synaptic connections. After eye opening, local connectivity reorganized extensively: more connections formed selectively between neurons with similar visual responses and connections were eliminated between visually unresponsive neurons, but the overall connectivity rate did not change. We propose a sequential model of cortical microcircuit development based on activity-dependent mechanisms of plasticity whereby neurons first acquire feature preference by selecting feedforward inputs before the onset of sensory experience--a process that may be facilitated by early electrical coupling between neuronal subsets--and then patterned input drives the formation of functional subnetworks through a redistribution of recurrent synaptic connections.},

Here we provide evidence that structural plasticity of inhibitory synapses onto pyramidal neurons is a major component of plasticity in the adult neocortex. In vivo two-photon imaging was used to monitor the formation and elimination of fluorescently labeled inhibitory structures on pyramidal neurons. We find that ocular dominance plasticity in the adult visual cortex is associated with rapid inhibitory synapse loss, especially of those present on dendritic spines. This occurs not only with monocular deprivation but also with subsequent restoration of binocular vision. We propose that in the adult visual cortex the experience-induced loss of inhibition may effectively strengthen specific visual inputs with limited need for rearranging the excitatory circuitry.},

In pyramidal cell populations, patterns of neuronal correlations were largely stimulus-dependent, indicating that their responses were not strongly dominated by functionally biased recurrent connectivity. By contrast, visual stimulation only weakly modified co-activation patterns of fast-spiking PV cells, consistent with the observation that these broadly tuned interneurons received very dense and strong synaptic input from nearby pyramidal cells with diverse feature selectivities. Therefore, feedforward and recurrent network influences determine the activity of excitatory and inhibitory ensembles in fundamentally different ways.},

But on the local scale, where dendrites and axons overlap substantially, the functional specificity of connections remains unknown. Here we determine synaptic connectivity between nearby layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in vitro, the response properties of which were first characterized in mouse visual cortex in vivo. We found that connection probability was related to the similarity of visually driven neuronal activity. Neurons with the same preference for oriented stimuli connected at twice the rate of neurons with orthogonal orientation preferences. Neurons responding similarly to naturalistic stimuli formed connections at much higher rates than those with uncorrelated responses. Bidirectional synaptic connections were found more frequently between neuronal pairs with strongly correlated visual responses. Our results reveal the degree of functional specificity of local synaptic connections in the visual cortex, and point to the existence of fine-scale subnetworks dedicated to processing related sensory information.},

To demonstrate the utility of this algorithm under experimental conditions, we evaluate its performance in decoding both population spike trains and calcium signals with different correlation structures.

  abstract        = {Sensory experiences exert a powerful influence on the function and future performance of neuronal circuits in the mammalian neocortex. Restructuring of synaptic connections is believed to be one mechanism by which cortical circuits store information about the sensory world. Excitatory synaptic structures, such as dendritic spines, are dynamic entities that remain sensitive to alteration of sensory input throughout life. It remains unclear, however, whether structural changes at the level of dendritic spines can outlast the original experience and thereby provide a morphological basis for long-term information storage. Here we follow spine dynamics on apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in functionally defined regions of adult mouse visual cortex during plasticity of eye-specific responses induced by repeated closure of one eye (monocular deprivation). The first monocular deprivation episode doubled the rate of spine formation, thereby increasing spine density. This effect was specific to layer-5 cells located in binocular cortex, where most neurons increase their responsiveness to the non-deprived eye. Restoring binocular vision returned spine dynamics to baseline levels, but absolute spine density remained elevated and many monocular deprivation-induced spines persisted during this period of functional recovery. However, spine addition did not increase again when the same eye was closed for a second time. This absence of structural plasticity stands out against the robust changes of eye-specific responses that occur even faster after repeated deprivation. Thus, spines added during the first monocular deprivation experience may provide a structural basis for subsequent functional shifts. These results provide a strong link between functional plasticity and specific synaptic rearrangements, revealing a mechanism of how prior experiences could be stored in cortical circuits.},

We increased the signal strength of troponin C-based calcium biosensors in the low-calcium regime by mutagenesis and domain rearrangement within the troponin C calcium binding moiety to generate the indicator TN-XXL. Using in vivo two-photon ratiometric imaging, we show that TN-XXL exhibits enhanced fluorescence changes in neurons of flies and mice. TN-XXL could be used to obtain tuning curves of orientation-selective neurons in mouse visual cortex measured repeatedly over days and weeks. Thus, the genetically encoded calcium indicator TN-XXL allows repeated imaging of response properties from individual, identified neurons in vivo, which will be crucial for gaining new insights into cellular mechanisms of plasticity, regeneration and disease.},

In this protocol we describe a chronic cranial window to obtain optical access to the mouse cerebral cortex for long-term imaging. A small bone flap is replaced with a coverglass, which is permanently sealed in place with dental acrylic, providing a clear imaging window with a large field of view (approximately 0.8-12 mm(2)). The surgical procedure can be completed within approximately 1 h. The preparation allows imaging over time periods of months with arbitrary imaging intervals. The large size of the imaging window facilitates imaging of ongoing structural plasticity of small neuronal structures in mice, with low densities of labeled neurons.

In order to further investigate the molecular events regulating structural plasticity, it would be useful to express multiple proteins in the same sparse neurons, allowing co-expression of functional proteins or co-labeling of subcellular compartments with other fluorescent proteins. However, it has been difficult to obtain reproducible expression in the same subset of neurons for direct comparison of neurons expressing different functional proteins. Here we describe a Cre-transgenic line that allows reproducible expression of transgenic proteins of choice in a small number of neurons of the adult cortex, hippocampus, striatum, olfactory bulb, subiculum, hypothalamus, superior colliculus and amygdala. We show that using these Cre-transgenic mice, multiple Cre-dependent transgenes can be expressed together in the same isolated neurons. We also describe a Cre-dependent transgenic line expressing a membrane associated EGFP (EGFP-F). Crossed with the Cre-transgenic line, EGFP-F expression starts in the adolescent forebrain, is present in dendrites, dendritic protrusions, axons and boutons and is strong enough for acute or chronic in vivo imaging. This triple transgenic approach will aid the morphological and functional characterization of neurons in various Cre-dependent transgenic mice.},

It is generally thought to depend on Hebbian forms of synaptic plasticity. In addition, neurons possess other, homeostatic means of compensating for changes in sensory input, but their role in cortical plasticity is unclear. We used two-photon calcium imaging to investigate whether homeostatic response regulation contributes to changes of eye-specific responsiveness after monocular deprivation (MD) in mouse visual cortex. Short MD durations decreased deprived-eye responses in neurons with binocular input. Longer MD periods strengthened open-eye responses, and surprisingly, also increased deprived-eye responses in neurons devoid of open-eye input. These bidirectional response adjustments effectively preserved the net visual drive for each neuron. Our finding that deprived-eye responses were either weaker or stronger after MD, depending on the amount of open-eye input a cell received, argues for both Hebbian and homeostatic mechanisms regulating neuronal responsiveness during experience-dependent plasticity.},

Much of the recent progress in identifying the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying ocular dominance plasticity has been achieved by using the mouse as a model system. In this species, monocular deprivation initiated in adulthood also causes robust ocular dominance shifts.

Here we show that in adult mice, the ability to adapt to changes can be improved profoundly if the mouse has already experienced a similar change in its sensory environment earlier in life. Using the standard model for sensory plasticity in mouse visual cortex-ocular dominance (OD) plasticity-we found that a transient shift in OD, induced by monocular deprivation (MD) earlier in life, renders the adult visual cortex highly susceptible to subsequent MD many weeks later. Irrespective of whether the first MD was experienced during the critical period (around postnatal day 28) or in adulthood, OD shifts induced by a second MD were faster, more persistent and specific to repeated deprivation of the same eye. The capacity for plasticity in the mammalian cortex can therefore be conditioned by past experience.},

In this scheme, the abolition of patterned retinal activity is not expected to influence overall retinotopic organization, but this has not been investigated. We used optical imaging of intrinsic signals to visualize the complete retinotopic map in the superior colliculus (SC) of mice lacking early retinal waves, caused by the deletion of the beta2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. As expected from previous anatomical studies in the SC of beta2(-/-) mice, regions activated by individual visual stimuli were much larger and had less sharp borders than those in wild-type mice. Importantly, however, we also found systematic distortions of the entire retinotopic map: the map of visual space was expanded anteriorly and compressed posteriorly. Thus, patterned neuronal activity in the early retina has a substantial influence on the coarse retinotopic organization of the SC.},

This effect, termed comodulation masking release (CMR), is attributed to both processing within one frequency channel of the auditory system and comparisons across separate frequency channels. Here we present data on CMR from a study in field L2 of the auditory forebrain of the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) using two 25-Hz-wide bands of masking noise that provide the opportunity to distinguish between within-channel and across-channel effects. Acoustically evoked responses were recorded from unrestrained birds via radio telemetry. The signal was a 800 msec pure tone presented at the most sensitive frequency of the units in a previously determined frequency-tuning curve (FTC). One band of masking noise was centered on the signal frequency while the flanking band of noise was presented either within the limits of the excitatory FTC (i.e., within the same frequency channel as the on-frequency masker) or in the suppression area of the FTC (i.e., in a separate channel). For flanking bands inside the excitatory FTC, signal detection thresholds based on the rate code were lower in noise maskers with identical envelope fluctuations (comodulated) than in maskers with uncorrelated envelopes resulting in a neural CMR of approximately 4-7 dB. For flanking bands inside the suppression areas, the neural CMR was reduced. Although the average neural CMR was below the behaviorally determined CMR, a subsample of between 11 and 26% of the recording sites resembled the behavioral performance.},

Glutamate peaked at 1.1 millimolar and decayed with a time constant of 1.2 milliseconds at cultured hippocampal synapses. This time course implies that transmitter saturates postsynaptic NMDA receptors. However, glutamate dissociates much more rapidly from alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. Thus, the time course of free glutamate predicts that dissociation contributes to the decay of the AMPA receptor-mediated postsynaptic current.},

Following rapid steps into high concentrations of glutamate, the activation time course was concentration-independent and limited by transitions between the shut, but fully liganded state and the open state. At lower concentrations, ligand binding was rate-limiting. The resulting sigmoidal activation time course was best fitted by a kinetic model with two glutamate binding sites. Glycine concentration jumps in the continuous presence of glutamate were also best fitted with a two-site model. Agonist and co-agonist binding were better described by an independent, rather than a sequential model. We suggest that the NMDA receptor is at least a tetramer containing four ligand binding subunits, assuming a single binding site per subunit.},

  abstract        = {AMPA and NMDA receptor channels are closely related molecules, yet they respond to glutamate with distinct kinetics, attributable to differences in ligand binding and channel gating steps (for review, see Edmonds et al., 1995). We used two complementary approaches to investigate the number of functional binding sites on AMPA channels on outside-out patches from cultured hippocampal neurons. The activation kinetics of agonist binding were measured during rapid steps into low concentrations of selective AMPA receptor agonists and during steps from a competitive AMPA receptor antagonist, 6-cyano-7-nitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione, into a saturating concentration of agonist. Both approaches revealed sigmoidal kinetics, which suggests that multiple agonist binding steps or antagonist unbinding steps are needed for channel activation. A kinetic model with two independent binding sites gave a better fit to the activation phase than models with one or three independent sites. A more refined analysis incorporating cooperative interaction between the two binding sites significantly improved the fits to the responses. The affinity of the first binding step was two to three times higher than the second step. These results demonstrate that binding of two agonist molecules are needed to activate AMPA receptors, but the two binding sites are not identical and independent. Because NMDA receptors require four ligand molecules for activation (two glycine and two glutamate; Benveniste and Mayer, 1991; Clements and Westbrook, 1991), it may be that some binding sites on AMPA receptors are functionally silent.},

Non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors mediate a component that has a rapid onset and decay while the component mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors has a slow rise-time and a decay of several hundred milliseconds, 100 times longer than the mean open time of NMDA channels. The slow decay of the NMDA-mediated e.p.s.c. could be due to residual glutamate in the synaptic cleft resulting in repeated binding and activation of NMDA receptors. However, in cultured hippocampal neurons, we find that the NMDA receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate has no effect on the slow e.p.s.c. when rapidly applied after activation of the synapse, suggesting that rebinding of glutamate does not occur. In addition, a brief pulse of glutamate to an outside-out membrane patch results in openings of NMDA channels that persist for hundreds of milliseconds, indicating that glutamate can remain bound for this period. These results imply that a brief pulse of glutamate in the synaptic cleft is sufficient to account for the slow e.p.s.c.},

The competitive antagonist, D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5), was used to study dissociation kinetics from NMDA receptors in outside-out patches from cultured hippocampal neurons. 2. Rapid steps from AP5 into NMDA produced currents with a sigmoidal activation time course that was limited by AP5 dissociation. Ensemble average currents were well fitted using kinetic models with two identical, cooperative antagonist binding sites per channel. The results suggest that the two NMDA binding sites have similar affinities, but that occupation of one site reduces the affinity of the other. 3.

The resulting clones are derived from two radial glia on average, span cortical layers 2-6, and are composed of a random sampling of transcriptomic cell types. We find an interaction between shared lineage and connection type: related neurons are more likely to be connected vertically across cortical layers, but not laterally within the same layer.

Nearly all excitatory neurons were pyramidal and all somatostatin-positive (SOM ) non-fast-spiking interneurons were Martinotti cells. In contrast, in somatosensory cortex (S1), excitatory neurons were mostly stellate and SOM  interneurons were non-Martinotti.

  abstract        = {Neurons exhibit a rich diversity of morphological phenotypes, electrophysiological properties, and gene-expression patterns. Understanding how these different characteristics are interrelated at the single-cell level has been difficult because of the lack of techniques for multimodal profiling of individual cells. We recently developed Patch-seq, a technique that combines whole-cell patch-clamp recording, immunohistochemistry, and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to comprehensively profile single neurons from mouse brain slices. Here, we present a detailed step-by-step protocol, including modifications to the patching mechanics and recording procedure, reagents and recipes, procedures for immunohistochemistry, and other tips to assist researchers in obtaining high-quality morphological, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic data from single neurons. Successful implementation of Patch-seq allows researchers to explore the multidimensional phenotypic variability among neurons and to correlate gene expression with phenotype at the level of single cells. The entire procedure can be completed in ∼2 weeks through the combined efforts of a skilled electrophysiologist, molecular biologist, and biostatistician.},

We recently developed Patch-seq, which combines whole-cell patch clamp recording with single-cell RNA-sequencing and immunohistochemistry to comprehensively profile the transcriptomic, morphologic, and physiologic features of individual neurons. Patch-seq can be broadly applied to characterize cell types in complex tissues such as the nervous system, and to study the transcriptional signatures underlying the multidimensional phenotypes of single cells.},

To improve the classification of neuronal cell types and the functional characterization of single neurons, we present Patch-seq, a method that combines whole-cell electrophysiological patch-clamp recordings, single-cell RNA-sequencing and morphological characterization. Following electrophysiological characterization, cell contents are aspirated through the patch-clamp pipette and prepared for RNA-sequencing. Using this approach, we generate electrophysiological and molecular profiles of 58 neocortical cells and show that gene expression patterns can be used to infer the morphological and physiological properties such as axonal arborization and action potential amplitude of individual neurons. Our results shed light on the molecular underpinnings of neuronal diversity and suggest that Patch-seq can facilitate the classification of cell types in the nervous system.},

  abstract        = {Recent biomarker innovations hold potential for transforming diagnosis, prognostic modeling, and precision therapeutic targeting of traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, many biomarkers, including brain imaging, genomics, and proteomics, involve vast quantities of high-throughput and high-content data. Management, curation, analysis, and evidence synthesis of these data are not trivial tasks. In this review, we discuss data management concepts and statistical and data sharing strategies when dealing with biomarker data in the context of TBI research. We propose that application of biomarkers involves three distinct steps-discovery, evaluation, and evidence synthesis. First, complex/big data has to be reduced to useful data elements at the stage of biomarker discovery. Second, inferential statistical approaches must be applied to these biomarker data elements for assessment of biomarker clinical utility and validity. Last, synthesis of relevant research is required to support practice guidelines and enable health decisions informed by the highest quality, up-to-date evidence available. We focus our discussion around recent experiences from the International Traumatic Brain Injury Research (InTBIR) initiative, with a specific focus on four major clinical projects (Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI, Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI, Collaborative Research on Acute Traumatic Brain Injury in Intensive Care Medicine in Europe, and Approaches and Decisions in Acute Pediatric TBI Trial), which are currently enrolling subjects in North America and Europe. We discuss common data elements, data collection efforts, data-sharing opportunities, and challenges, as well as examine the statistical techniques required to realize successful adoption and use of biomarkers in the clinic as a foundation for precision medicine in TBI.},

  abstract        = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is currently classified as mild, moderate, or severe TBI by trichotomizing the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). We aimed to explore directions for a more refined multidimensional classification system. For that purpose, we performed a hypothesis-free cluster analysis in the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research for TBI (CENTER-TBI) database: a European all-severity TBI cohort (  = 4509). The first building block consisted of key imaging characteristics, summarized using principal component analysis from 12 imaging characteristics. The other building blocks were demographics, clinical severity, secondary insults, and cause of injury. With these building blocks, the patients were clustered into four groups. We applied bootstrap resampling with replacement to study the stability of cluster allocation. The characteristics that predominantly defined the clusters were injury cause, major extracranial injury, and GCS. The clusters consisted of 1451, 1534, 1006, and 518 patients, respectively. The clustering method was quite stable: the proportion of patients staying in one cluster after resampling and reclustering was 97.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 85.6-99.9%). These clusters characterized groups of patients with different functional outcomes: from mild to severe, 12%, 19%, 36%, and 58% of patients had unfavorable 6 month outcome. Compared with the mild and the upper intermediate cluster, the lower intermediate and the severe cluster received more key interventions. To conclude, four types of TBI patients may be defined by injury mechanism, presence of major extracranial injury and GCS. Describing patients according to these three characteristics could potentially capture differences in etiology and care pathways better than with GCS only.},

  abstract        = {The aim of this study is to investigate the prognostic value of using the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) standardized imaging-based pathoanatomic descriptors for the evaluation and reporting of acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) lesions. For a total of 3392 patients (2244 males and 1148 females, median age = 51 years) enrolled in the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) study, we extracted 96 Common Data Elements (CDEs) from the structured reports, spanning all three levels of pathoanatomic information (i.e., 20 "basic," 60 "descriptive," and 16 "advanced" CDE variables per patient). Six-month clinical outcome scores were dichotomized into favorable (Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended [GOS-E] = 5-8) versus unfavorable (GOS-E = 1-4). Regularized logistic regression models were constructed and compared using the optimism-corrected area under the curve (AUC). An abnormality was reported for the majority of patients (64.51%). In 79.11% of those patients, there was at least one coexisting pathoanatomic lesion or associated finding. An increase in lesion severity, laterality, and volume was associated with more unfavorable outcomes. Compared with the full set of pathoanatomic descriptors (i.e., all three categories of information), reporting "basic" CDE information provides at least equal discrimination between patients with favorable versus unfavorable outcome (AUC = 0.8121 vs. 0.8155, respectively). Addition of a selected subset of "descriptive" detail to the basic CDEs could improve outcome prediction (AUC = 0.8248). Addition of "advanced" or "emerging/exploratory" information had minimal prognostic value. Our results show that the NINDS standardized-imaging based pathoanatomic descriptors can be used in large-scale studies and provide important insights into acute TBI lesion patterns. When used in clinical predictive models, they can provide excellent discrimination between patients with favorable and unfavorable 6-month outcomes. If further validated, our findings could support the development of structured and itemized templates in routine clinical radiology.},

  abstract        = {The burden of traumatic brain injury (TBI) poses a large public health and societal problem, but the characteristics of patients and their care pathways in Europe are poorly understood. We aimed to characterise patient case-mix, care pathways, and outcomes of TBI. CENTER-TBI is a Europe-based, observational cohort study, consisting of a core study and a registry. Inclusion criteria for the core study were a clinical diagnosis of TBI, presentation fewer than 24 h after injury, and an indication for CT. Patients were differentiated by care pathway and assigned to the emergency room (ER) stratum (patients who were discharged from an emergency room), admission stratum (patients who were admitted to a hospital ward), or intensive care unit (ICU) stratum (patients who were admitted to the ICU). Neuroimages and biospecimens were stored in repositories and outcome was assessed at 6 months after injury. We used the IMPACT core model for estimating the expected mortality and proportion with unfavourable Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) outcomes in patients with moderate or severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score ≤12). The core study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02210221, and with Resource Identification Portal (RRID: SCR_015582). Data from 4509 patients from 18 countries, collected between Dec 9, 2014, and Dec 17, 2017, were analysed in the core study and from 22 782 patients in the registry. In the core study, 848 (19%) patients were in the ER stratum, 1523 (34%) in the admission stratum, and 2138 (47%) in the ICU stratum. In the ICU stratum, 720 (36%) patients had mild TBI (GCS score 13-15). Compared with the core cohort, the registry had a higher proportion of patients in the ER (9839 [43%]) and admission (8571 [38%]) strata, with more than 95% of patients classified as having mild TBI. Patients in the core study were older than those in previous studies (median age 50 years [IQR 30-66], 1254 [28%] aged >65 years), 462 (11%) had serious comorbidities, 772 (18%) were taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication, and alcohol was contributory in 1054 (25%) TBIs. MRI and blood biomarker measurement enhanced characterisation of injury severity and type. Substantial inter-country differences existed in care pathways and practice. Incomplete recovery at 6 months (GOSE <8) was found in 207 (30%) patients in the ER stratum, 665 (53%) in the admission stratum, and 1547 (84%) in the ICU stratum. Among patients with moderate-to-severe TBI in the ICU stratum, 623 (55%) patients had unfavourable outcome at 6 months (GOSE <5), similar to the proportion predicted by the IMPACT prognostic model (observed to expected ratio 1·06 [95% CI 0·97-1·14]), but mortality was lower than expected (0·70 [0·62-0·76]). Patients with TBI who presented to European centres in the core study were older than were those in previous observational studies and often had comorbidities. Overall, most patients presented with mild TBI. The incomplete recovery of many patients should motivate precision medicine research and the identification of best practices to improve these outcomes.

A total of 2050 admission computed tomography (CT) scans from subjects enrolled in the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) study were analyzed for seven main CT characteristics. Kappa statistics were used to calculate agreement between central and local evaluations and a center-specific analysis was performed. The McNemar test was used to detect whether discordances were significant. Central interobserver and intra-observer agreement was calculated in a subset of patients. Good agreement was found between central and local assessment for the presence or absence of structural pathology (CT+, CT-, κ = 0.73) and most CT characteristics (κ = 0.62 to 0.71), except for traumatic axonal injury lesions (κ = 0.37). Despite good kappa values, discordances were significant in four of seven CT characteristics (i.e., midline shift, contusion, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cisternal compression; p = 0.0005). Central reviewers showed substantial to excellent interobserver and intra-observer agreement (κ = 0.73 to κ = 0.96), contrasted by considerable variability in local radiological reading. Compared with local evaluation, a central review process offers a more consistent radiological reading of acute CT characteristics in TBI. It generates reliable, reproducible data and should be recommended for use in multi-center TBI studies.},

  abstract        = {We aimed to investigate the extent of the agreement on practices around brain death and postmortem organ donation. Investigators from 67 Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) study centers completed several questionnaires (response rate: 99%). Regarding practices around brain death, we found agreement on the clinical evaluation (prerequisites and neurological assessment) for brain death determination (BDD) in 100% of the centers. However, ancillary tests were required for BDD in 64% of the centers. BDD for nondonor patients was deemed mandatory in 18% of the centers before withdrawing life-sustaining measures (LSM). Also, practices around postmortem organ donation varied. Organ donation after circulatory arrest was forbidden in 45% of the centers. When withdrawal of LSM was contemplated, in 67% of centers the patients with a ventricular drain in situ had this removed, either sometimes or all of the time. This study showed both agreement and some regional differences regarding practices around brain death and postmortem organ donation. We hope our results help quantify and understand potential differences, and provide impetus for current dialogs toward further harmonization of practices around brain death and postmortem organ donation.},

  abstract        = {General supportive and preventive measures in the intensive care management of traumatic brain injury (TBI) aim to prevent or limit secondary brain injury and optimize recovery. The aim of this survey was to assess and quantify variation in perceptions on intensive care unit (ICU) management of patients with TBI in European neurotrauma centers. We performed a survey as part of the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) study. We analyzed 23 questions focused on: 1) circulatory and respiratory management; 2) fever control; 3) use of corticosteroids; 4) nutrition and glucose management; and 5) seizure prophylaxis and treatment. The survey was completed predominantly by intensivists (n = 33, 50%) and neurosurgeons (n = 23, 35%) from 66 centers (97% response rate). The most common cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) target was > 60 mmHg (n = 39, 60%) and/or an individualized target (n = 25, 38%). To support CPP, crystalloid fluid loading (n = 60, 91%) was generally preferred over albumin (n = 15, 23%), and vasopressors (n = 63, 96%) over inotropes (n = 29, 44%). The most commonly reported target of partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO ) was 36-40 mmHg (4.8-5.3 kPa) in case of controlled intracranial pressure (ICP) < 20 mmHg (n = 45, 69%) and PaCO  target of 30-35 mmHg (4-4.7 kPa) in case of raised ICP (n = 40, 62%). Almost all respondents indicated to generally treat fever (n = 65, 98%) with paracetamol (n = 61, 92%) and/or external cooling (n = 49, 74%). Conventional glucose management (n = 43, 66%) was preferred over tight glycemic control (n = 18, 28%). More than half of the respondents indicated to aim for full caloric replacement within 7 days (n = 43, 66%) using enteral nutrition (n = 60, 92%). Indications for and duration of seizure prophylaxis varied, and levetiracetam was mostly reported as the agent of choice for both seizure prophylaxis (n = 32, 49%) and treatment (n = 40, 61%). Practice preferences vary substantially regarding general supportive and preventive measures in TBI patients at ICUs of European neurotrauma centers. These results provide an opportunity for future comparative effectiveness research, since a more evidence-based uniformity in good practices in general ICU management could have a major impact on TBI outcome.},

  abstract        = {No definitive evidence exists on how intracranial hypertension should be treated in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). It is therefore likely that centers and practitioners individually balance potential benefits and risks of different intracranial pressure (ICP) management strategies, resulting in practice variation. The aim of this study was to examine variation in monitoring and treatment policies for intracranial hypertension in patients with TBI. A 29-item survey on ICP monitoring and treatment was developed on the basis of literature and expert opinion, and it was pilot-tested in 16 centers. The questionnaire was sent to 68 neurotrauma centers participating in the Collaborative European Neurotrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) study. The survey was completed by 66 centers (97% response rate). Centers were mainly academic hospitals (n = 60, 91%) and designated level I trauma centers (n = 44, 67%). The Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines were used in 49 (74%) centers. Approximately 90% of the participants (n = 58) indicated placing an ICP monitor in patients with severe TBI and computed tomographic abnormalities. There was no consensus on other indications or on peri-insertion precautions. We found wide variation in the use of first- and second-tier treatments for elevated ICP. Approximately half of the centers were classified as using a relatively aggressive approach to ICP monitoring and treatment (n = 32, 48%), whereas the others were considered more conservative (n = 34, 52%). Substantial variation was found regarding monitoring and treatment policies in patients with TBI and intracranial hypertension. The results of this survey indicate a lack of consensus between European neurotrauma centers and provide an opportunity and necessity for comparative effectiveness research.},

  abstract        = {Current classification of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is suboptimal, and management is based on weak evidence, with little attempt to personalize treatment. A need exists for new precision medicine and stratified management approaches that incorporate emerging technologies. To improve characterization and classification of TBI and to identify best clinical care, using comparative effectiveness research approaches. This multicenter, longitudinal, prospective, observational study in 22 countries across Europe and Israel will collect detailed data from 5400 consenting patients, presenting within 24 hours of injury, with a clinical diagnosis of TBI and an indication for computed tomography. Broader registry-level data collection in approximately 20,000 patients will assess generalizability. Cross sectional comprehensive outcome assessments, including quality of life and neuropsychological testing, will be performed at 6 months. Longitudinal assessments will continue up to 24 months post TBI in patient subsets. Advanced neuroimaging and genomic and biomarker data will be used to improve characterization, and analyses will include neuroinformatics approaches to address variations in process and clinical care. Results will be integrated with living systematic reviews in a process of knowledge transfer. The study initiation was from October to December 2014, and the recruitment period was for 18 to 24 months. Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI should provide novel multidimensional approaches to TBI characterization and classification, evidence to support treatment recommendations, and benchmarks for quality of care. Data and sample repositories will ensure opportunities for legacy research. Comparative effectiveness research provides an alternative to reductionistic clinical trials in restricted patient populations by exploiting differences in biology, care, and outcome to support optimal personalized patient management.},

  abstract        = {In vivo, cortical pyramidal cells are bombarded by asynchronous synaptic input arising from ongoing network activity. However, little is known about how such 'background' synaptic input interacts with nonlinear dendritic mechanisms. We have modified an existing model of a layer 5 (L5) pyramidal cell to explore how dendritic integration in the apical dendritic tuft could be altered by the levels of network activity observed in vivo. Here we show that asynchronous background excitatory input increases neuronal gain and extends both temporal and spatial integration of stimulus-evoked synaptic input onto the dendritic tuft. Addition of fast and slow inhibitory synaptic conductances, with properties similar to those from dendritic targeting interneurons, that provided a 'balanced' background configuration, partially counteracted these effects, suggesting that inhibition can tune spatio-temporal integration in the tuft. Excitatory background input lowered the threshold for NMDA receptor-mediated dendritic spikes, extended their duration and increased the probability of additional regenerative events occurring in neighbouring branches. These effects were also observed in a passive model where all the non-synaptic voltage-gated conductances were removed. Our results show that glutamate-bound NMDA receptors arising from ongoing network activity can provide a powerful spatially distributed nonlinear dendritic conductance. This may enable L5 pyramidal cells to change their integrative properties as a function of local network activity, potentially allowing both clustered and spatially distributed synaptic inputs to be integrated over extended timescales.},

However, little is known about how such networks respond to excitatory synaptic input. To investigate this, we studied electrically coupled Golgi cells (GoC) in the cerebellar input layer. We show with immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and electrophysiology that Connexin-36 is necessary for functional gap junctions (GJs) between GoC dendrites. In the absence of coincident synaptic input, GoCs synchronize their firing. In contrast, sparse, coincident mossy fiber input triggered a mixture of excitation and inhibition of GoC firing and spike desynchronization. Inhibition is caused by propagation of the spike afterhyperpolarization through GJs. This triggers network desynchronization because heterogeneous coupling to surrounding cells causes spike-phase dispersion. Detailed network models predict that desynchronization is robust, local, and dependent on synaptic input properties. Our results show that GJ coupling can be inhibitory and either promote network synchronization or trigger rapid network desynchronization depending on the synaptic input.},

  abstract        = {Biologically detailed single neuron and network models are important for understanding how ion channels, synapses and anatomical connectivity underlie the complex electrical behavior of the brain. While neuronal simulators such as NEURON, GENESIS, MOOSE, NEST, and PSICS facilitate the development of these data-driven neuronal models, the specialized languages they employ are generally not interoperable, limiting model accessibility and preventing reuse of model components and cross-simulator validation. To overcome these problems we have used an Open Source software approach to develop NeuroML, a neuronal model description language based on XML (Extensible Markup Language). This enables these detailed models and their components to be defined in a standalone form, allowing them to be used across multiple simulators and archived in a standardized format. Here we describe the structure of NeuroML and demonstrate its scope by converting into NeuroML models of a number of different voltage- and ligand-gated conductances, models of electrical coupling, synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity, together with morphologically detailed models of individual neurons. We have also used these NeuroML-based components to develop an highly detailed cortical network model. NeuroML-based model descriptions were validated by demonstrating similar model behavior across five independently developed simulators. Although our results confirm that simulations run on different simulators converge, they reveal limits to model interoperability, by showing that for some models convergence only occurs at high levels of spatial and temporal discretisation, when the computational overhead is high. Our development of NeuroML as a common description language for biophysically detailed neuronal and network models enables interoperability across multiple simulation environments, thereby improving model transparency, accessibility and reuse in computational neuroscience.},

With ageing, sensorimotor delays are prolonged, posing a critical threat to balance. We study a generic model of stabilisation with neural delays to understand how the organism should adapt to challenging balance conditions. The model suggests that ankle stiffness should be increased in anticipation of perturbations, for example by muscle co-contraction, so as to slow down body fall during the neural response delay. Increased ankle muscle co-contraction is indeed observed in young adults when standing in challenging balance conditions, and in older relative to young adults during normal stance. In parallel, the analysis of the model shows that increases in either stiffness or neural delay must be coordinated with decreases in spinal sensorimotor gains, otherwise the feedback itself becomes destabilizing. Accordingly, a decrease in spinal feedback is observed in challenging conditions, and with age-related increases in neural delay. These observations have been previously interpreted as indicating an increased reliance on cortical rather than spinal control of balance, despite the fact that cortical responses have a longer latency. Our analysis challenges this interpretation by showing that these observations are consistent with a functional coadaptation of spinal feedback gains to functional changes in stiffness and neural delay.},

These models can feature novel dynamical equations, their interactions with the environment, and experimental protocols. To preserve high performance when defining new models, most simulators offer two options: low-level programming or description languages. The first option requires expertise, is prone to errors, and is problematic for reproducibility. The second option cannot describe all aspects of a computational experiment, such as the potentially complex logic of a stimulation protocol. Brian addresses these issues using runtime code generation. Scientists write code with simple and concise high-level descriptions, and Brian transforms them into efficient low-level code that can run interleaved with their code. We illustrate this with several challenging examples: a plastic model of the pyloric network, a closed-loop sensorimotor model, a programmatic exploration of a neuron model, and an auditory model with real-time input.},

This performance may be affected by the subjects adjusting their initial posture in anticipation of the perturbation. Do elderly fallers and non-fallers adjust their posture in anticipation of externally-imposed perturbations in a laboratory setting? How does this impact their balance recovery performance? 21 elderly non-fallers, 18 age-matched elderly fallers and 11 young adults performed both a forward waist-pull perturbation task and a Choice Stepping Reaction Time (CSRT) task. Whole-body kinematics and ground reaction forces were recorded. For each group, we evaluated the balance recovery performance in the perturbation task, change in initial center of mass (CoM) position between the CSRT and the perturbation task, and the influence of initial CoM position on task performance. The balance recovery performance of elderly fallers was equivalent to elderly non-fallers (p > 0.5 Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). All subject groups anticipated forward perturbations by shifting their CoM backward compared to the CSRT task (young: 2.1% of lower limb length, elderly non-fallers: 2.7%, elderly fallers: 2.2%, Hodges-Lehmann estimator, p < 0.001 Mann-Whitney U). This backward shift increases the probability of resisting the traction without taking a step. The ability to anticipate perturbations is preserved in elderly fallers and may explain their preserved balance recovery performance in laboratory-based perturbation tasks. Therefore, future fall risk prediction studies should carefully control for this postural strategy, by interleaving perturbations of different directions for example.},

  abstract        = {In most vertebrate neurons, action potentials are triggered at the distal end of the axon initial segment (AIS). Both position and length of the AIS vary across and within neuron types, with activity, development and pathology. What is the impact of AIS geometry on excitability? Direct empirical assessment has proven difficult because of the many potential confounding factors. Here, we carried a principled theoretical analysis to answer this question. We provide a simple formula relating AIS geometry and sodium conductance density to the somatic voltage threshold. A distal shift of the AIS normally produces a (modest) increase in excitability, but we explain how this pattern can reverse if a hyperpolarizing current is present at the AIS, due to resistive coupling with the soma. This work provides a theoretical tool to assess the significance of structural AIS plasticity for electrical function.},

  abstract     = {Advances in experimental techniques and computational power allowing researchers to gather anatomical and electrophysiological data at unprecedented levels of detail have fostered the development of increasingly complex models in computational neuroscience. Large-scale, biophysically detailed cell models pose a particular set of computational challenges, and this has led to the development of a number of domain-specific simulators. At the other level of detail, the ever growing variety of point neuron models increases the implementation barrier even for those based on the relatively simple integrate-and-fire neuron model. Independently of the model complexity, all modeling methods crucially depend on an efficient and accurate transformation of mathematical model descriptions into efficiently executable code. Neuroscientists usually publish model descriptions in terms of the mathematical equations underlying them. However, actually simulating them requires they be translated into code. This can cause problems because errors may be introduced if this process is carried out by hand, and code written by neuroscientists may not be very computationally efficient. Furthermore, the translated code might be generated for different hardware platforms, operating system variants or even written in different languages and thus cannot easily be combined or even compared. Two main approaches to addressing this issues have been followed. The first is to limit users to a fixed set of optimized models, which limits flexibility. The second is to allow model definitions in a high level interpreted language, although this may limit performance. Recently, a third approach has become increasingly popular: using code generation to automatically translate high level descriptions into efficient low level code to combine the best of previous approaches. This approach also greatly enriches efforts to standardize simulator-independent model description languages. In the past few years, a number of code generation pipelines have been developed in the computational neuroscience community, which differ considerably in aim, scope and functionality. This article provides an overview of existing pipelines currently used within the community and contrasts their capabilities and the technologies and concepts behind them.},

  abstract        = {"Neural coding" is a popular metaphor in neuroscience, where objective properties of the world are communicated to the brain in the form of spikes. Here I argue that this metaphor is often inappropriate and misleading. First, when neurons are said to encode experimental parameters, the neural code depends on experimental details that are not carried by the coding variable (e.g., the spike count). Thus, the representational power of neural codes is much more limited than generally implied. Second, neural codes carry information only by reference to things with known meaning. In contrast, perceptual systems must build information from relations between sensory signals and actions, forming an internal model. Neural codes are inadequate for this purpose because they are unstructured and therefore unable to represent relations. Third, coding variables are observables tied to the temporality of experiments, whereas spikes are timed actions that mediate coupling in a distributed dynamical system. The coding metaphor tries to fit the dynamic, circular, and distributed causal structure of the brain into a linear chain of transformations between observables, but the two causal structures are incongruent. I conclude that the neural coding metaphor cannot provide a valid basis for theories of brain function, because it is incompatible with both the causal structure of the brain and the representational requirements of cognition.},

The AIS location varies not only axially, along the axon, but axons also emerge variably from either the soma or proximal dendrites.

However, from the consideration of the mechanical requirements for movement, we argue that posture is adjusted in view of providing impetus for movement. Thus, we show that the posture that is usually adopted in quiet standing in fact allows torque for potential movement. Moreover, when performing a movement-either voluntarily or in response to an external perturbation-we show that the postural adjustments are organized both spatially and temporally so as to provide the required torque for the movement. Thus, when movement is performed skillfully, the force of gravity is not counteracted but actually used to provide impetus to movement. This ability to move one's weight so as to exploit the torque of gravity seems to be dependent on development and skill learning, and is impaired in aging.},

It is often described as the perceptual correlate of the periodicity of the sound's waveform. Previous reports have shown that pitch can depend slightly on sound level. We wanted to verify that these observations reflect genuine changes in perceived pitch, and were not due to procedural factors or confusion between dimensions of pitch and level. We first conducted a systematic pitch matching task and confirmed that the pitch of low frequency pure tones, but not complex tones, decreases by an amount equivalent to a change in frequency of more than half a semitone when level increases. We then showed that the structure of pitch shifts is anti-symmetric and transitive, as expected for changes in pitch. We also observed shifts in the same direction (although smaller) in an interval matching task. Finally, we observed that musicians are more precise in pitch matching tasks than non-musicians but show the same average shifts with level. These combined experiments confirm that the pitch of low frequency pure tones depends weakly but systematically on level. These observations pose a challenge to current theories of pitch.},

  abstract        = {In most vertebrate neurons, spikes initiate in the axonal initial segment (AIS). When recorded in the soma, they have a surprisingly sharp onset, as if sodium (Na) channels opened abruptly. The main view stipulates that spikes initiate in a conventional manner at the distal end of the AIS, then progressively sharpen as they backpropagate to the soma. We examined the biophysical models used to substantiate this view, and we found that spikes do not initiate through a local axonal current loop that propagates along the axon, but through a global current loop encompassing the AIS and soma, which forms an electrical dipole. Therefore, the phenomenon is not adequately modeled as the backpropagation of an electrical wave along the axon, since the wavelength would be as large as the entire system. Instead, in these models, we found that spike initiation rather follows the critical resistive coupling model proposed recently, where the Na current entering the AIS is matched by the axial resistive current flowing to the soma. Besides demonstrating it by examining the balance of currents at spike initiation, we show that the observed increase in spike sharpness along the axon is artifactual and disappears when an appropriate measure of rapidness is used; instead, somatic onset rapidness can be predicted from spike shape at initiation site. Finally, we reproduce the phenomenon in a two-compartment model, showing that it does not rely on propagation. In these models, the sharp onset of somatic spikes is therefore not an artifact of observing spikes at the incorrect location, but rather the signature that spikes are initiated through a global soma-AIS current loop forming an electrical dipole.},

Although axons often emanate directly from the soma, they may also originate more distally from a dendrite, the implications of which are not well-understood. Here, we show that one-third of the thick-tufted layer 5 pyramidal neurons have an axon originating from a dendrite and are characterized by a reduced dendritic complexity and thinner main apical dendrite. Unexpectedly, the rising phase of somatic APs is electrically indistinguishable between neurons with a somatic or a dendritic axon origin. Cable analysis of the neurons indicated that the axonal axial current is inversely proportional to the AIS distance, denoting the path length between the soma and the start of the AIS, and to produce invariant somatic APs, it must scale with the local somatodendritic capacitance. In agreement, AIS distance inversely correlates with the apical dendrite diameter, and model simulations confirmed that the covariation suffices to normalize the somatic AP waveform. Therefore, in pyramidal neurons, the AIS location is finely tuned with the somatodendritic capacitive load, serving as a homeostatic regulation of the somatic AP in the face of diverse neuronal morphologies.},

In this work, we address the question of how such an algorithm can be implemented by neurons, and apply it in the context of audio stimuli. We propose a projected gradient implementation of SFA that can be adapted to a Hebbian like learning rule dealing with biologically plausible neuron models. Furthermore, we show that a Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity learning rule, shaped as a smoothed second derivative, implements SFA for spiking neurons. The theory is supported by numerical simulations, and to illustrate a simple use of SFA, we have applied it to auditory signals. We show that a single SFA neuron can learn to extract the tempo in sound recordings.},

  abstract        = {New sensory stimuli can be learned with a single or a few presentations. Similarly, the responses of cortical neurons to a stimulus have been shown to increase reliably after just a few repetitions. Long-term memory is thought to be mediated by synaptic plasticity, but in vitro experiments in cortical cells typically show very small changes in synaptic strength after a pair of presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes. Thus, it is traditionally thought that fast learning requires stronger synaptic changes, possibly because of neuromodulation. Here we show theoretically that weak synaptic plasticity can, in fact, support fast learning, because of the large number of synapses N onto a cortical neuron. In the fluctuation-driven regime characteristic of cortical neurons in vivo, the size of membrane potential fluctuations grows only as √N, whereas a single output spike leads to potentiation of a number of synapses proportional to N. Therefore, the relative effect of a single spike on synaptic potentiation grows as √N. This leverage effect requires precise spike timing. Thus, the large number of synapses onto cortical neurons allows fast learning with very small synaptic changes. Significance statement: Long-term memory is thought to rely on the strengthening of coactive synapses. This physiological mechanism is generally considered to be very gradual, and yet new sensory stimuli can be learned with just a few presentations. Here we show theoretically that this apparent paradox can be solved when there is a tight balance between excitatory and inhibitory input. In this case, small synaptic modifications applied to the many synapses onto a given neuron disrupt that balance and produce a large effect even for modifications induced by a single stimulus. This effect makes fast learning possible with small synaptic changes and reconciles physiological and behavioral observations.},

  abstract        = {Interaural time difference (ITD) is a major cue to sound localization in humans and animals. For a given subject and position in space, ITD depends on frequency. This variation is analyzed here using a head related transfer functions (HRTFs) database collected from the literature and comprising human HRTFs from 130 subjects and animal HRTFs from six specimens of different species. For humans, the ITD is found to vary with frequency in a way that shows consistent differences with respect to a spherical head model. Maximal ITD values were found to be about 800 μs in low frequencies and 600 μs in high frequencies. The ITD variation with frequency (up to 200 μs for some positions) occurs within the frequency range where ITD is used to judge the lateral position of a sound source. In addition, ITD varies substantially within the bandwidth of a single auditory filter, leading to systematic differences between envelope and fine-structure ITDs. Because the frequency-dependent pattern of ITD does not display spherical symmetries, it potentially provides cues to elevation and resolves front/back confusion. The fact that the relation between position and ITDs strongly depends on the sound's spectrum in turn suggests that humans and animals make use of this relationship for the localization of sounds.},

It varies systematically with spatial direction and is generally modeled as a pure time delay, independent of frequency. In acoustical recordings, we found that interaural delay varies with frequency at a fine scale. In physiological recordings of midbrain neurons sensitive to interaural delay, we found that preferred delay also varies with sound frequency. Similar observations reported earlier were not incorporated in a functional framework. We find that the frequency dependence of acoustical and physiological interaural delays are matched in key respects. This suggests that binaural neurons are tuned to acoustical features of ecological environments, rather than to fixed interaural delays. Using recordings from the nerve and brainstem we show that this tuning may emerge from neurons detecting coincidences between input fibers that are mistuned in frequency.},

  abstract     = {Musical notes can be ordered from low to high along a perceptual dimension called "pitch". A characteristic property of these sounds is their periodic waveform, and periodicity generally correlates with pitch. Thus, pitch is often described as the perceptual correlate of the periodicity of the sound's waveform. However, the existence and salience of pitch also depends in a complex way on other factors, in particular harmonic content. For example, periodic sounds made of high-order harmonics tend to have a weaker pitch than those made of low-order harmonics. Here we examine the theoretical proposition that pitch is the perceptual correlate of the regularity structure of the vibration pattern of the basilar membrane, across place and time-a generalization of the traditional view on pitch. While this proposition also attributes pitch to periodic sounds, we show that it predicts differences between resolved and unresolved harmonic complexes and a complex domain of existence of pitch, in agreement with psychophysical experiments. We also present a possible neural mechanism for pitch estimation based on coincidence detection, which does not require long delays, in contrast with standard temporal models of pitch.},

The spike trains of neurons in the auditory system must represent the fine temporal structure of sounds despite a tremendous variation in sound level in natural environments. It has been shown in vitro that the transformation from dynamic signals into precise spike trains can be accurately captured by simple integrate-and-fire models. In this work, we show that the in vivo responses of cochlear nucleus bushy cells to sounds across a wide range of levels can be precisely predicted by deterministic integrate-and-fire models with adaptive spike threshold. Our model can predict both the spike timings and the firing rate in response to novel sounds, across a large input level range. A noisy version of the model accounts for the statistical structure of spike trains, including the reliability and temporal precision of responses. Spike threshold adaptation was critical to ensure that predictions remain accurate at different levels. These results confirm that simple integrate-and-fire models provide an accurate phenomenological account of spike train statistics and emphasize the functional relevance of spike threshold adaptation.},

Here, two established techniques are combined to estimate an animal's HRTF from photographs by taking into account as much morphological detail as possible. The first step of the method consists in building a three-dimensional-model of the animal from pictures taken with a standard camera. The HRTFs are then estimated by means of a rapid boundary-element-method implementation. This combined method is validated on a taxidermist model of a cat by comparing binaural and monaural localization cues extracted from estimated and measured HRTFs. It is shown that it provides a reliable way to estimate low-frequency HRTF, which is difficult to obtain with standard acoustical measurements procedures because of reflections.},

In the auditory brainstem, a recent theory proposes that sound location in the horizontal plane is decoded from the relative summed activity of two populations in each hemisphere, whereas earlier theories hypothesized that the location was decoded from the identity of the most active cells. We tested the performance of various decoders of neural responses in increasingly complex acoustical situations, including spectrum variations, noise, and sound diffraction. We demonstrate that there is insufficient information in the pooled activity of each hemisphere to estimate sound direction in a reliable way consistent with behavior, whereas robust estimates can be obtained from neural activity by taking into account the heterogeneous tuning of cells. These estimates can still be obtained when only contralateral neural responses are used, consistently with unilateral lesion studies. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01312.001.},

Reflections make sound localization difficult, and it is thought that the auditory system deals with this issue by isolating the first wavefront and suppressing later signals. However, in many situations, reflections arrive too early to be suppressed, for example, reflections from the ground in small animals. This paper examines the implications of these early reflections on binaural cues to sound localization, using realistic models of reflecting surfaces and a spherical model of diffraction by the head. The fusion of direct and reflected signals at each ear results in interference patterns in binaural cues as a function of frequency. These cues are maximally modified at frequencies related to the delay between direct and reflected signals, and therefore to the spatial location of the sound source. Thus, natural binaural cues differ from anechoic cues. In particular, the range of interaural time differences is substantially larger than in anechoic environments. Reflections may potentially contribute binaural cues to distance and polar angle when the properties of the reflecting surface are known and stable, for example, for reflections on the ground.},

The electrode response is traditionally removed using bridge balance, where the response of an ideal resistor representing the electrode is subtracted from the measurement. Because the electrode is not an ideal resistor, this procedure produces capacitive transients in response to fast or discontinuous currents. More sophisticated methods exist, but they all require a preliminary calibration phase, to estimate the properties of the electrode. If these properties change after calibration, the measurements are corrupted. We propose a compensation method that does not require preliminary calibration. Measurements are compensated offline by fitting a model of the neuron and electrode to the trace and subtracting the predicted electrode response. The error criterion is designed to avoid the distortion of compensated traces by spikes. The technique allows electrode properties to be tracked over time and can be extended to arbitrary models of electrode and neuron. We demonstrate the method using biophysical models and whole cell recordings in cortical and brain-stem neurons.},

In binaural neurons of the barn owl, tuning to interaural delays is independent of level differences. Yet a monaural neuron with a fixed threshold should fire earlier in response to louder sounds, which would disrupt the tuning of these neurons. How could spike timing be independent of input level? Here I derive theoretical conditions for a spiking model to be insensitive to input level. The key property is a dynamic change in spike threshold. I then show how level invariance can be physiologically implemented, with specific ionic channel properties. It appears that these ingredients are indeed present in monaural neurons of the sound localization pathway of birds and mammals.},

Two main theories compete: neurons could temporally integrate noisy inputs (rate-based theories) or they could detect coincident input spikes (spike timing-based theories). Correlations at fine timescales have been observed in many areas of the nervous system, but they might have a minor impact. To address this issue, we used a probabilistic approach to quantify the impact of coincidences on neuronal response in the presence of fluctuating synaptic activity. We found that when excitation and inhibition are balanced, as in the sensory cortex in vivo, synchrony in a very small proportion of inputs results in dramatic increases in output firing rate. Our theory was experimentally validated with in vitro recordings of cortical neurons of mice. We conclude that not only are noisy neurons well equipped to detect coincidences, but they are so sensitive to fine correlations that a rate-based description of neural computation is unlikely to be accurate in general.},

  abstract     = {The human cochlea includes about 3000 inner hair cells which filter sounds at frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. This massively parallel frequency analysis is reflected in models of auditory processing, which are often based on banks of filters. However, existing implementations do not exploit this parallelism. Here we propose algorithms to simulate these models by vectorizing computation over frequency channels, which are implemented in "Brian Hears," a library for the spiking neural network simulator package "Brian." This approach allows us to use high-level programming languages such as Python, because with vectorized operations, the computational cost of interpretation represents a small fraction of the total cost. This makes it possible to define and simulate complex models in a simple way, while all previous implementations were model-specific. In addition, we show that these algorithms can be naturally parallelized using graphics processing units, yielding substantial speed improvements. We demonstrate these algorithms with several state-of-the-art cochlear models, and show that they compare favorably with existing, less flexible, implementations.},

  abstract     = {In the hippocampus and the neocortex, the coupling between local field potential (LFP) oscillations and the spiking of single neurons can be highly precise, across neuronal populations and cell types. Spike phase (i.e., the spike time with respect to a reference oscillation) is known to carry reliable information, both with phase-locking behavior and with more complex phase relationships, such as phase precession. How this precision is achieved by neuronal populations, whose membrane properties and total input may be quite heterogeneous, is nevertheless unknown. In this note, we investigate a simple mechanism for learning precise LFP-to-spike coupling in feed-forward networks - the reliable, periodic modulation of presynaptic firing rates during oscillations, coupled with spike-timing dependent plasticity. When oscillations are within the biological range (2-150 Hz), firing rates of the inputs change on a timescale highly relevant to spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). Through analytic and computational methods, we find points of stable phase-locking for a neuron with plastic input synapses. These points correspond to precise phase-locking behavior in the feed-forward network. The location of these points depends on the oscillation frequency of the inputs, the STDP time constants, and the balance of potentiation and de-potentiation in the STDP rule. For a given input oscillation, the balance of potentiation and de-potentiation in the STDP rule is the critical parameter that determines the phase at which an output neuron will learn to spike. These findings are robust to changes in intrinsic post-synaptic properties. Finally, we discuss implications of this mechanism for stable learning of spike-timing in the hippocampus.},

The temporal accuracy required to detect ITD, and how ITD is initially encoded, continue to puzzle scientists. A fundamental question is whether the monaural inputs to the binaural ITD detectors differ only in their timing, when temporal and spectral tunings are largely inseparable in the auditory pathway. Here, we investigate the spectrotemporal selectivity of the monaural inputs to ITD detector neurons of the owl. We found that these inputs are selective for instantaneous frequency glides. Modeling shows that ITD tuning depends strongly on whether the monaural inputs are spectrotemporally matched, an effect that may generalize to mammals. We compare the spectrotemporal selectivity of monaural inputs of ITD detector neurons in vivo, demonstrating that their selectivity matches. Finally, we show that this refinement can develop through spike timing-dependent plasticity. Our findings raise the unexplored issue of time-dependent frequency tuning in auditory coincidence detectors and offer a unifying perspective.},

These interaural time differences (ITDs) are encoded by binaural neurons which fire more when the ITD matches their "best delay." In the textbook model of sound localization, the best delays of binaural neurons reflect the differences in axonal delays of their monaural inputs, but recent observations have cast doubts on this classical view because best delays were found to depend on preferred frequency. Here, we show that these observations are in fact consistent with the notion that best delays are created by differences in axonal delays, provided ITD tuning is created during development through spike-timing-dependent plasticity: basilar membrane filtering results in correlations between inputs to binaural neurons, which impact the selection of synapses during development, leading to the observed distribution of best delays.},

Rodent barrel cortex contains a somatotopic map for vibrissa identity, but the existence of maps representing other tactile features has not been clearly demonstrated. We addressed the issue of the existence in the rat cortex of an intrabarrel map for vibrissa movement direction using in vivo two-photon imaging. We discovered that the emergence of a direction map in rat barrel cortex occurs long after all known critical periods in the somatosensory system. This map is remarkably specific, taking a pinwheel-like form centered near the barrel center and aligned to the barrel cortex somatotopy. We suggest that this map may arise from intracortical mechanisms and demonstrate by simulation that the combination of spike-timing-dependent plasticity at synapses between layer 4 and layer 2/3 and realistic pad stimulation is sufficient to produce such a map. Its late emergence long after other classical maps suggests that experience-dependent map formation and refinement continue throughout adult life.},

However, beyond simple time differences, the way in which neurons might extract this information is unclear and the potential computational advantages are unknown. The computational difficulty of this task for an animal is to locate the source of an unexpected sound from two monaural signals that are highly dependent on the unknown source signal. In neuron models consisting of spectro-temporal filtering and spiking nonlinearity, we found that the binaural structure induced by spatialized sounds is mapped to synchrony patterns that depend on source location rather than on source signal. Location-specific synchrony patterns would then result in the activation of location-specific assemblies of postsynaptic neurons. We designed a spiking neuron model which exploited this principle to locate a variety of sound sources in a virtual acoustic environment using measured human head-related transfer functions. The model was able to accurately estimate the location of previously unknown sounds in both azimuth and elevation (including front/back discrimination) in a known acoustic environment. We found that multiple representations of different acoustic environments could coexist as sets of overlapping neural assemblies which could be associated with spatial locations by Hebbian learning. The model demonstrates the computational relevance of relative spike timing to extract spatial information about sources independently of the source signal.},

In particular, the rate of a neuron can be very sensitive to a dimension while poorly informative about it, if it is also sensitive to other dimensions. One implication is that in a multi-dimensional world, stimulus properties such as ITD are optimally coded with heterogeneous neural populations.},

What is the nature and mode of computation performed in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) given the physiology of L5 pyramidal neurons? First, we experimentally establish active properties of the dendrites of L5 pyramidal neurons of mouse V1 using patch-clamp recordings. Using a detailed multi-compartmental model, we show this physiological setup to be well suited for coincidence detection between basal and apical tuft inputs by controlling the frequency of spike output. We further show how direct inhibition of calcium channels in the dendrites modulates such coincidence detection. To establish the singe-cell computation that this biophysics supports, we show that the combination of frequency-modulation of somatic output by tuft input and (simulated) calcium-channel blockage functionally acts as a composite sigmoidal function. Finally, we explore how this computation provides a mechanism whereby dendritic spiking contributes to orientation tuning in pyramidal neurons.},

  abstract        = {We simulated the shape and amplitude of extracellular action potentials (APs or "spikes") using biophysical models based on detailed reconstructions of single neurons from the cat's visual cortex. We compared these predictions with spikes recorded from the cat's primary visual cortex under a standard protocol. The experimental data were derived from a large number of neurons throughout all layers. The majority of spikes were biphasic, with a dominant negative peak (mean amplitude, -0.11 mV), whereas a minority of APs had a dominant positive peak of +0.54-mV mean amplitude, with a maximum of +1.5 mV. The largest positive amplitude spikes were recorded in layer 5. The simulations demonstrated that a pyramidal neuron under known biophysical conditions may generate a negative peak with amplitude up to -1.5 mV, but that the amplitude of the positive peak may be at most 0.5 mV. We confirmed that spikes with large positive peaks were not produced by juxtacellular patch recordings. We conclude that there is a significant gap in our present understanding of either the spike-generation process in pyramidal neurons, the biophysics of extracellular recording, or both.},

We investigated an identified neuron (the lobula giant movement detector, LGMD, of locusts) whose output firing rate in response to looming visual stimuli has been described by two models, one of which involves a multiplication. In this model, the LGMD multiplies postsynaptically two inputs (one excitatory, one inhibitory) that converge onto its dendritic tree; in the other model, inhibition is presynaptic to the LGMD. By using selective activation and inactivation of pre- and postsynaptic inhibition, we show that postsynaptic inhibition has a predominant role, suggesting that multiplication is implemented within the neuron itself. Our pharmacological experiments and measurements of firing rate versus membrane potential also reveal that sodium channels act both to advance the response of the LGMD in time and to map membrane potential to firing rate in a nearly exponential manner. These results are consistent with an implementation of multiplication based on dendritic subtraction of two converging inputs encoded logarithmically, followed by exponentiation through active membrane conductances.},

Classical cable theory focuses on analyzing the voltage or current attenuation of a synaptic signal as it propagates from its dendritic input location to the spike initiation zone. On the other hand, we are interested in analyzing the amount of information lost about the signal in this process due to the presence of various noise sources distributed throughout the neuronal membrane. We use a stochastic version of the linear one-dimensional cable equation to derive closed-form expressions for the second-order moments of the fluctuations of the membrane potential associated with different membrane current noise sources: thermal noise, noise due to the random opening and closing of sodium and potassium channels, and noise due to the presence of "spontaneous" synaptic input. We consider two different scenarios. In the signal estimation paradigm, the time course of the membrane potential at a location on the cable is used to reconstruct the detailed time course of a random, band-limited current injected some distance away. Estimation performance is characterized in terms of the coding fraction and the mutual information. In the signal detection paradigm, the membrane potential is used to determine whether a distant synaptic event occurred within a given observation interval. In the light of our analytical results, we speculate that the length of weakly active apical dendrites might be limited by the information loss due to the accumulated noise between distal synaptic input sites and the soma and that the presence of dendritic nonlinearities probably serves to increase dendritic information transfer.},

  abstract        = {The majority of neural network models consider the output of single neurons to be a continuous, positive, and saturating firing rate f (t), while a minority treat neuronal output as a series of delta pulses sigma delta (t-ti). We here argue that the issue of the proper output representation relates to the biophysics of the cells in question and, in particular, to whether initiation of somatic action potentials occurs when a certain threshold voltage or a threshold current is exceeded. We approach this issue using numerical simulations of the electrical behavior of a layer 5 pyramidal cell from cat visual cortex. The dendritic tree is passive while the cell body includes eight voltage- and calcium-dependent membrane conductances. We compute both the steady-state (Istatic(infinity)(Vm)) and the instantaneous (I0(Vm)) I-V relationships and argue that the amplitude of the local maximum in Istatic(infinity)(Vm) corresponds to the current threshold Ith for sustained inputs, while the location of the middle zero-crossing of I0 corresponds to a fixed voltage threshold Vth for rapid inputs. We confirm this using numerical simulations: for "rapid" synaptic inputs, spikes are initiated if the somatic potential exceeds Vth, while for slowly varying input Ith must be exceeded. Due to the presence of the large dendritic tree, no charge threshold Qth exists for physiological input. Introducing the temporal average of the somatic membrane potential <Vm> while the cell is spiking repetitively, allows us to define a dynamic I-V relationship Idynamic(infinity)(<Vm>). We find an exponential relationship between <Vm> and the net current sunk by the somatic membrane during spiking (diode-like behavior). The slope of Idynamic(infinity)(<Vm>) allows us to define a dynamic input conductance and a time constant that characterizes how rapidly the cell changes its output firing frequency in response to a change in its input.},

Behaviourally relevant features need to be extracted from this representation for further processing. In the electrosensory system of weakly electric fish, single P-type electroreceptor afferents accurately encode the time course of random modulations in electric-field amplitude. We applied a stimulus estimation method and a signal-detection method to both P-receptor afferents and their targets, the pyramidal cells in the electrosensory lateral-line lobe. We found that although pyramidal cells do not accurately convey detailed information about the time course of the stimulus, they reliably encode up- and downstrokes of random modulations in electric-field amplitude. The presence of such temporal features is best signalled by short bursts of spikes, probably caused by dendritic processing, rather than by isolated spikes. Furthermore, pyramidal cells outperform P-receptor afferents in signalling the presence of temporal features in the stimulus waveform. We conclude that the sensory neurons are specialized to acquire information accurately with little processing, whereas the following stage extracts behaviourally relevant features, thus performing a nonlinear pattern-recognition task.},

  abstract        = {A recent report has provided evidence that there are no significant increases in the neuronal input conductance during the response of cortical cells in cat visual cortex to non-preferred visual stimuli (Douglas et al., 1988). A criticism of experiments of this kind is that changes in the membrane conductance occurring in the dendritic tree may not be visible from electrodes that impale the soma. Our paper describes theoretical and numerical results concerning the visibility of synaptically induced conductance changes from intracellular electrodes, in both ideal and anatomically well-characterized cortical neurons. Based on earlier work by Rall (1967), we here derive theoretical expressions for the change in input conductance at any location in a passive dendritic tree resulting from activation of a single synapse and obtain bounds for the effects of multiple synapses. We find that the conductance change measured at the cell body is always less than the sum of the synaptic conductance changes and that this observed conductance change does not depend on the synaptic reversal potential. For the case of an infinite dendritic cylinder, the change in input resistance due to a single synaptic input decays exponentially with distance of the synapse from the recording site. Numerical simulations of synaptic inputs that change approximately as fast as the membrane time-constant produce an increase in input conductance that is only slightly less visible than that of a constant input. We also compute the changes in somatic input conductance of 2 morphologically identified pyramidal cells from cat visual cortex during activity of a single inhibitory basket cell with known synaptic input locations. We find that the increase in conductance due to the activity of the inhibitory basket cells is clearly visible from the cell body of the pyramidal cells and that a 70% reduction in the amplitude of excitation is associated with at least a 30% increase in somatic input conductance, which would be visible in intracellular recordings. Taken together with the negative experimental evidence of Douglas et al. (1988), our results cast doubt on a large class of models of direction selectivity that rely on synaptically mediated inhibitory conductance increases to veto or block excitatory conductances increases.},

A new measure of spike timing jitter was developed using the notion of spike train distances recently introduced by Victor and Purpura. This measure of variability is widely applicable to neuronal responses, irrespective of the type of stimuli used (deterministic vs. random) or the reliability of the recorded spike trains. In our data, the mean spike count and its variance measured in short time windows were poorly correlated with the reliability of P-receptor afferent spike trains, implying that such measures provide unreliable indices of trial-to-trial variability. P-receptor afferent spike trains were considerably less variable than those of Poisson model neurons. The average timing jitter of spikes lay within 1-2 cycles of the electric organ discharge (EOD). At low, but not at high firing rates, the timing jitter was dependent on the cutoff frequency of the stimulus and, to a lesser extent, on its contrast. When spikes were artificially manipulated to increase jitter, information conveyed by P-receptor afferents was degraded only for average jitters considerably larger than those observed experimentally. This suggests that the intrinsic variability of single spike trains lies outside of the range where it might degrade the information conveyed, yet still allows for improvement in coding by averaging across multiple afferent fibers. Our results were summarized in a phenomenological model of P-receptor afferents, incorporating both their linear transfer properties and the variability of their spike trains. This model complements an earlier one proposed by Nelson et al. for P-receptor afferents of Apteronotus. Because of their relatively high precision with respect to the EOD cycle frequency, P-receptor afferent spike trains possess the temporal resolution necessary to support coincidence detection operations at the next stage in the amplitude-coding pathway.},

  abstract        = {1. In neocortical slices, the majority of neurons fire quite regularly in response to constant current injections. But neurons in the intact animal fire irregularly in response to constant current injection as well as to visual stimuli. 2. To quantify this observation, we developed a new measure of variability, which compares only adjacent interspike intervals and is therefore less sensitive to rate variations than existing measures such as the coefficient of variation of interspike intervals. 3. We find that the variability of firing is much higher in cells of primary visual cortex in the anesthetized cat than in slice. The response to current injected from an intracellular electrode in vivo is also variable, but slightly more regular and less bursty than in response to visual stimuli. 4. Using a new technique for analyzing the variability of integrate-and-fire neurons, we prove that this behavior is consistent with a simple integrate-and-fire model receiving a large amount of synaptic background activity, but not with a noisy spiking mechanism.},

  abstract  = {Electrical stimulation of neural systems is a key tool for understanding neural dynamics and ultimately for developing clinical treatments. Many applications of electrical stimulation affect large populations of neurons. However, computational models of large networks of spiking neurons are inherently hard to simulate and analyze. We evaluate a reduced mean-field model of excitatory and inhibitory adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (AdEx) neurons which can be used to efficiently study the effects of electrical stimulation on large neural populations. The rich dynamical properties of this basic cortical model are described in detail and validated using large network simulations. Bifurcation diagrams reflecting the network’s state reveal asynchronous up- and down-states, bistable regimes, and oscillatory regions corresponding to fast excitation-inhibition and slow excitation-adaptation feedback loops. The biophysical parameters of the AdEx neuron can be coupled to an electric field with realistic field strengths which then can be propagated up to the population description. We show how on the edge of bifurcation, direct electrical inputs cause network state transitions, such as turning on and off oscillations of the population rate. Oscillatory input can frequency-entrain and phase-lock endogenous oscillations. Relatively weak electric field strengths on the order of 1 V/m are able to produce these effects, indicating that field effects are strongly amplified in the network. The effects of time-varying external stimulation are well-predicted by the mean-field model, further underpinning the utility of low-dimensional neural mass models.},

Single-channel currents activated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) agonists were analysed in the presence of various extracellular concentrations of divalent cations in outside-out patches from mouse neurones in primary culture. 2. In nominally Mg2+-free solutions the opening and closing of the channels leads to rectangular current pulses, the mean duration of which varies little with membrane potential. After addition of Mg2+, the single-channel currents recorded at negative potentials appear in bursts of short openings separated by brief closures. 3. The duration of the short openings decreases with increasing Mg2+ concentration, while the duration of the short closures is independent of the Mg2+ concentration. Depolarization increases the duration of the short openings and decreases the duration of the short closures. 4. The dependence of the burst structure on the Mg2+ concentration and on membrane potential is compatible to a first approximation with a model in which Mg2+ ions enter the open channel and block it by binding at a deep site. A better approximation requires, however, additional assumptions such as Mg2+ permeation and/or interactions between Ca2+ and Mg2+. 5. Increasing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration from 1 to 100 mM produces three effects on the currents flowing through NMDA channels. It shifts the reversal potential towards a positive value (+30 mV); it reduces the outward current flowing through the NMDA channels at very positive potentials; it reduces the inward current flowing at negative potentials. 6. The interpretation of the effects of Ca2+ appears to require three hypotheses: that Ca2+ permeates the NMDA channel, that there exists a significant surface potential at the entrance of the NMDA channel in physiological solutions and that both Ca2+ and monovalent cations bind to the channel, binding being stronger in the case of Ca2+ ions. 7. While Co2+ and, to a lesser extent, Mn2+ mimic the effects of Mg2+ on the NMDA channel, Ca2+, Ba2+ and Cd2+ do not. The distinction between Mg2+-like and Ca2+-like divalent cations corresponds to a difference in the speed of exchange of the water molecules surrounding the cations in solutions. Thus, it is possible that permeation occurs for all the divalent cations, but is slower for those which are slowly dehydrated.},

Whole-cell recordings from hippocampal neurons in culture were used to determine the voltage dependence of the NMDA conductance in the presence of extracellular magnesium concentrations from 1 microM to 10 mM. The conductance-voltage data are well fitted by a gating function derived from rate constants determined in an earlier study of the kinetic behavior of single channels activated by NMDA. The results are consistent with the assumption that magnesium inhibits current through the NMDA-activated channel by directly blocking the ion pore. In addition, another voltage-dependent blocking or flicker-producing mechanism has to be invoked to account for the behavior of the conductance at both the single-channel and whole-cell level, especially at low concentrations of extracellular magnesium.},

These bursts apparently result from short interruptions of current flow during periods when the channel is in the open configuration. Single-channel currents evoked by NMDA have been studied in outside-out patches of membrane taken from hippocampal CA 1 neurons grown in dissociated cell culture. The effects of changing external Mg concentration and holding potential on the single-channel parameters of open time, closed time, and burst length have been successfully described assuming a 3- or 4-state model with 1 open state, 1 or 2 "blocked" states, and 1 absorbing closed state. Evaluation of the blocking rates over Mg concentrations from 0.2-200 microM indicate that a single "blocking" mechanism cannot account for the short closed states and that a second voltage-dependent but Mg-independent "blocked" state is necessary to explain the data especially at low Mg concentrations.},

  abstract        = {There is considerable evidence that glutamate is the principal neurotransmitter that mediates fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the vertebrate central nervous system. This single transmitter seems to activate two or three distinct types of receptors, defined by their affinities for three selective structural analogues of glutamate, NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), quisqualate and kainate. All these agonists increase membrane permeability to monovalent cations, but NMDA also activates a conductance that permits significant calcium influx and is blocked in a voltage-dependent manner by extracellular magnesium. Fast synaptic excitation seems to be mediated mainly by kainate/quisqualate receptors, although NMDA receptors are sometimes activated. We have investigated the properties of these conductances using single-channel recording in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons, because the hippocampus contains all subtypes of glutamate receptors and because long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission occurs in this structure. We find that four or more distinct single-channel currents are evoked by applying glutamate to each outside-out membrane patch. These conductances vary in their ionic permeability and in the agonist most effective in causing them to open. Clear transitions between all the conductance levels are observed. Our observations are compatible with the model that all the single channel conductances activated by glutamate reflect the operation of one or two complex molecular entities.},

In electrophysiological experiments the diarylguanidines blocked N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-activated ion channels. These diarylguanidines also protected rat hippocampal neurons in vitro from glutamate-induced cell death. Our results show that some diarylguanidines are noncompetitive antagonists of NMDA receptor-mediated responses and have the neuroprotective property that is commonly associated with blockers of the NMDA receptor-gated cation channel. Diarylguanidines are structurally unrelated to known blockers of NMDA channels and, therefore, represent a new compound series for the development of neuroprotective agents with therapeutic value in patients suffering from stroke, from brain or spinal cord trauma, from hypoglycemia, and possibly from brain ischemia due to heart attack.},

Little is known, however, about the synaptic properties of NMDA receptors in the local circuits of recurrent excitation, a leading candidate mechanism underlying working memory. We investigated the NMDA receptor-mediated currents at monosynaptic connections between pairs of layer 5 pyramidal neurons. We found that NMDA receptor-mediated currents at prefrontal synapses in the adult, but not young, rats exhibit a twofold longer decay time-constant and temporally summate a train of stimuli more effectively, compared to those in the primary visual cortex. Experiments with pharmacological, immunocytochemical, and biochemical approaches further suggest that, in the adult animals, neurons express significantly more NR2B subunits in the prefrontal cortex than the visual cortex. The NR2B-rich synapses in the prefrontal circuitry may be critically implicated in online cognitive computations and plasticity in learning, as well as psychiatric disorders.},

Unexpectedly, we found that weak synapses exhibited 3-fold more VGCCs than strong synapses, while the coupling distance was 5-fold longer. Reaction-diffusion modeling could explain both functional and structural data with two strikingly different nanotopographical motifs: strong synapses are composed of SVs that are tightly coupled (∼10 nm) to VGCC clusters, whereas at weak synapses VGCCs were excluded from the vicinity (∼50 nm) of docked vesicles.

  abstract        = {CA3 pyramidal cells display input-specific differences in the subunit composition of synaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs). Although at low density, GluN2B contributes significantly to NMDAR-mediated EPSCs at mossy fibre synapses. Long-term potentiation (LTP) of NMDARs triggers a modification in the subunit composition of synaptic NMDARs by insertion of GluN2B. GluN2B subunits are essential for the expression of LTP of NMDARs at mossy fibre synapses. Single neurons express NMDA receptors (NMDARs) with distinct subunit composition and biophysical properties that can be segregated in an input-specific manner. The dynamic control of the heterogeneous distribution of synaptic NMDARs is crucial to control input-dependent synaptic integration and plasticity. In hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells from mice of both sexes, we found that mossy fibre (MF) synapses display a markedly lower proportion of GluN2B-containing NMDARs than associative/commissural synapses. The mechanism involved in such heterogeneous distribution of GluN2B subunits is not known. Here we show that long-term potentiation (LTP) of NMDARs, which is selectively expressed at MF-CA3 pyramidal cell synapses, triggers a modification in the subunit composition of synaptic NMDARs by insertion of GluN2B. This activity-dependent recruitment of GluN2B at mature MF-CA3 pyramidal cell synapses contrasts with the removal of GluN2B subunits at other glutamatergic synapses during development and in response to activity. Furthermore, although expressed at low levels, GluN2B is necessary for the expression of LTP of NMDARs at MF-CA3 pyramidal cell synapses. Altogether, we reveal a previously unknown activity-dependent regulation and function of GluN2B subunits that may contribute to the heterogeneous plasticity induction rules in CA3 pyramidal cells.},

How these risk factors interact to drive disease onset is currently unknown. Here we begin to elucidate the mechanisms by which post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at a young age contributes to an increased risk to develop dementia at old age. We show that the actin nucleator Formin 2 (  is deregulated in PTSD and in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Young mice lacking the   gene exhibit PTSD-like phenotypes and corresponding impairments of synaptic plasticity, while the consolidation of new memories is unaffected. However,   mutant mice develop accelerated age-associated memory decline that is further increased in the presence of additional risk factors and is mechanistically linked to a loss of transcriptional homeostasis. In conclusion, our data present a new approach to explore the connection between AD risk factors across life span and provide mechanistic insight to the processes by which neuropsychiatric diseases at a young age affect the risk for developing dementia.},

We synthesized a diffusible photochromic glutamate analogue, azobenzene-triazole-glutamate (ATG), which is specific for NMDARs and functions as a photoswitchable agonist. ATG is inactive in its dark-adapted trans-isoform, but can be converted into its active cis-isoform using one-photon (near UV) or two-photon (740 nm) excitation. Irradiation with violet light photo-inactivates ATG within milliseconds, allowing agonist removal on the timescale of NMDAR deactivation. ATG is compatible with Ca(2+) imaging and can be used to optically mimic synaptic coincidence detection protocols. Thus, ATG can be used like traditional caged glutamate compounds, but with the added advantages of NMDAR specificity, low antagonism of GABAR-mediated currents, and precise temporal control of agonist delivery.},

Here we show that this equilibrium can be unlocked by increased activity of layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the mouse neocortex. Somatic depolarization or short bursts of action potentials of layer 5 pyramidal neurons induced a selective long-term potentiation of GABAergic synapses (LTPi) without affecting glutamatergic inputs. Remarkably, LTPi was selective for perisomatic inhibition from parvalbumin basket cells, leaving dendritic inhibition intact. It relied on retrograde signaling of nitric oxide, which persistently altered presynaptic GABA release and diffused to inhibitory synapses impinging on adjacent pyramidal neurons. LTPi reduced the time window of synaptic summation and increased the temporal precision of spike generation. Thus, increases in single cortical pyramidal neuron activity can induce an interneuron-selective GABAergic plasticity effectively altering the computation of temporally coded information.},

However, the role of extrastriatal A(2A)Rs in modulating psychomotor activity is largely unexplored because of the low level of expression and lack of tools to distinguish A(2A)Rs in intrinsic striatal versus nonstriatal neurons. Here, we provided direct evidence for the critical role of A(2A)Rs in extrastriatal neurons in modulating psychomotor behavior using newly developed striatum-specific A(2A)R knock-out (st-A(2A)R KO) mice in comparison with forebrain-specific A(2A)R KO (fb-A(2A)R KO) mice. In contrast to fb-A(2A)R KO (deleting A(2A)Rs in the neurons of striatum as well as cerebral cortex and hippocampus), st-A(2A)R KO mice exhibited Cre-mediated selective deletion of the A(2A)R gene, mRNA, and proteins in the neurons (but not astrocytes and microglial cells) of the striatum only. Strikingly, cocaine- and phencyclidine-induced psychomotor activities were enhanced in st-A(2A)R KO but attenuated in fb-A(2A)R KO mice. Furthermore, selective inactivation of the A(2A)Rs in extrastriatal cells by administering the A(2A)R antagonist KW6002 into st-A(2A)R KO mice attenuated cocaine effects, whereas KW6002 administration into wild-type mice enhanced cocaine effects. These results identify a critical role of A(2A)Rs in extrastriatal neurons in providing a prominent excitatory effect on psychomotor activity. These results indicate that A(2A)Rs in striatal and extrastriatal neurons exert an opposing modulation of psychostimulant effects and provide the first direct demonstration of a predominant facilitatory role of extrastriatal A(2A)Rs.},

  abstract        = {Kainate receptors (KARs) are heteromeric ionotropic glutamate receptors that play a variety of functions in the regulation of the activity of synaptic networks. Little is known about the regulation of the function of synaptic KARs in the brain. In the present study, we found that a conditioning activation of synaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs) induces short-term depression of KAR-EPSCs but not of AMPA receptor-EPSCs at synapses between mossy fibers and CA3 pyramidal cells. Short-term depression of KAR-EPSCs by synaptic NMDARs peaked at 1 s and reversed within 20 s, was likely induced and expressed postsynaptically, and was homosynaptic. It depended on a rise of Ca2+ in the postsynaptic cell and on the activation of the phosphatase calcineurin that likely binds to the GluR6b (glutamate receptor subunit 6b) subunit splice variant allowing the dephosphorylation of KARs and inhibition of activity. Finally, we show in the current-clamp mode that short-term depression of KAR-EPSPs is induced by the coincident discharge of action potentials in the postsynaptic cell together with synaptic stimulation. Hence, this study describes a form of short-term synaptic plasticity that is postsynaptic, depends on the temporal order of presynaptic and postsynaptic spiking, and likely affects the summation properties of mossy fiber EPSPs.},

  abstract        = {Cobalt is suspected to cause memory deficit in humans and was reported to induce neurotoxicity in animal models. We have studied the effects of cobalt in primary cultures of mouse astrocytes. CoCl(2) (0.2-0.8mM) caused dose-dependent ATP depletion, apoptosis (cell shrinkage, phosphatidylserine externalization and chromatin rearrangements) and secondary necrosis. The mitochondria appeared to be a main target of cobalt toxicity, as shown by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) and release from the mitochondria of apoptogenic factors, e.g. apoptosis inducing factor (AIF). Pre-treatment with bongkrekic acid reduced ATP depletion, implicating the involvement of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore. Cobalt increased the generation of oxygen radicals, but antioxidants did not prevent toxicity. There was also an impaired response to ATP stimulation, evaluated as a lower raise in intracellular calcium. Similarly to hypoxia and dymethyloxallyl glycine (DMOG), cobalt triggered stabilization of the alpha-subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1 (HIF-1alpha). This early event was followed by an increased expression of HIF-1 regulated genes, e.g. stress protein HO-1, pro-apoptotic factor Nip3 and iNOS. Although all of the three stimuli activated the HIF-1alpha pathway and decreased ATP levels, the downstream effects were different. DMOG only inhibited cell proliferation, whereas the other two conditions caused cell death by apoptosis and necrosis. This points to cobalt and hypoxia not only inducing HIF-1alpha regulated genes but also affecting similarly other cellular functions, including metabolism.},

Although it has been suggested that BDNF also modulates adult hippocampus glutamatergic transmission, this remains a matter of controversy. To clarify a putative role for this neurotrophin in the modulation of glutamate release we applied exogenous BDNF to isolated adult rat hippocampal nerve terminals. BDNF, at 100 ng/ml, potentiated by 25% the K(+)-evoked release of [(3)H]glutamate from hippocampal synaptosomes. The small effect of BDNF on [(3)H]glutamate release correlated with a modest increase in phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma) phosphorylation, and with the lack of effect of BDNF on extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt phosphorylation. Immunocytochemistry studies demonstrated that only about one-third of glutamatergic synaptosomes were positive for TrkB immunoreactivity. Furthermore, biotinylation and subsynaptic fractionation studies showed that only one-fourth of total full-length TrkB was present at the plasma membrane, evenly distributed between the presynaptic active zone and the postsynaptic density. These results indicate that BDNF modulates synaptic transmission presynaptically in a small subset of hippocampal glutamatergic synapses that contain TrkB and that express the receptor on the plasma membrane.},

In the present study, we demonstrate that heteromerization of adenosine A1 receptors (A1Rs) and A2A receptors (A2ARs) allows adenosine to exert a fine-tuning modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission. By means of coimmunoprecipitation, bioluminescence and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer techniques, we showed the existence of A1R-A2AR heteromers in the cell surface of cotransfected cells. Immunogold detection and coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that A1R and A2AR are colocalized in the same striatal glutamatergic nerve terminals. Radioligand-binding experiments in cotransfected cells and rat striatum showed that a main biochemical characteristic of the A1R-A2AR heteromer is the ability of A2AR activation to reduce the affinity of the A1R for agonists. This provides a switch mechanism by which low and high concentrations of adenosine inhibit and stimulate, respectively, glutamate release. Furthermore, it is also shown that A1R-A2AR heteromers constitute a unique target for caffeine and that chronic caffeine treatment leads to modifications in the function of the A1R-A2AR heteromer that could underlie the strong tolerance to the psychomotor effects of caffeine.},

We now confirmed that activation of adenosine A(2A) receptors with 2-[4-(2-p-carboxyethyl)phenylamino]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (CGS 21680, 1-30 nM) or 2-hexynyl-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (HENECA, 3-100 nM) facilitated the veratridine-evoked [3H]acetylcholine release from hippocampal synaptosomes with a maximal effect of 14+/-2% and 16+/-2%, respectively. These effects were prevented by the adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonists, 4-(2-[7-amino-2-[2-furyl][1,2,4]-triazolo[2,3a][1,3,5]triazin-5-yl-amino]ethyl)phenol (ZM 241385, 20 nM) and 5-amino-7-(2-phenylethyl)-2-(2-furyl)-pyrazolo-[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine (SCH 58261, 20 nM), but not by the adenosine A(1) receptor antagonist, 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX, 20 nM). Adenosine A(2A) receptors may activate adenylate cyclase and protein kinase A since CGS 21680 (10 nM) facilitation of [3H]acetylcholine release was occluded by 8-bromo-cAMP (0.5 mM) and forskolin (10 microM) and prevented by H-89 (1 microM), but unaffected by phorbol-12,13-didecanoate (250 nM) or bisindolylmaleimide I (1 microM). The existence of adenosine A(2A) receptors in hippocampal nerve terminals was further confirmed by a Western blot immunoreactivity qualitatively identical to that found in the striatum.

  abstract        = {Recent studies have shown that local cortical feedback can have an important effect on the response of neurons in primary visual cortex to the orientation of visual stimuli. In this work, we study the role of the cortical feedback in shaping the spatiotemporal patterns of activity in cortex. Two questions are addressed: one, what are the limitations on the ability of cortical neurons to lock their activity to rotating oriented stimuli within a single receptive field? Two, can the local architecture of visual cortex lead to the generation of spontaneous traveling pulses of activity? We study these issues analytically by a population-dynamic model of a hypercolumn in visual cortex. The order parameter that describes the macroscopic behavior of the network is the time-dependent population vector of the network. We first study the network dynamics under the influence of a weakly tuned input that slowly rotates within the receptive field. We show that if the cortical interactions have strong spatial modulation, the network generates a sharply tuned activity profile that propagates across the hypercolumn in a path that is completely locked to the stimulus rotation. The resultant rotating population vector maintains a constant angular lag relative to the stimulus, the magnitude of which grows with the stimulus rotation frequency. Beyond a critical frequency the population vector does not lock to the stimulus but executes a queasi-periodic motion with an average frequency that is smaller than that of the stimulus. In the second part we consider the stable intrinsic state of the cortex under the influence of isotropic stimulation. We show that if the local inhibitory feedback is sufficiently strong, the network does not settle into a stationary state but develops spontaneous traveling pulses of activity. Unlike recent models of wave propagation in cortical networks, the connectivity pattern in our model is spatially symmetric, hence the direction of propagation of these waves is arbitrary. The interaction of these waves with an external-oriented stimulus is studied. It is shown that the system can lock to a weakly tuned rotating stimulus if the stimulus frequency is close to the frequency of the intrinsic wave.},

  abstract        = {The developing brain can respond quickly to altered sensory experience by circuit reorganization. During a critical period in early life, neurons in the primary visual cortex rapidly lose responsiveness to an occluded eye and come to respond better to the open eye. While physiological and some of the molecular mechanisms of this process have been characterized, its structural basis, except for the well-known changes in the thalamocortical projection, remains obscure. To elucidate the relationship between synaptic remodeling and functional changes during this experience-dependent process, we used 2-photon microscopy to image synaptic structures of sparsely labeled layer 2/3 neurons in the binocular zone of mouse primary visual cortex. Anatomical changes at presynaptic and postsynaptic sites in mice undergoing monocular visual deprivation (MD) were compared to those in control mice with normal visual experience. We found that postsynaptic spines remodeled quickly in response to MD, with neurons more strongly dominated by the deprived eye losing more spines. These postsynaptic changes parallel changes in visual responses during MD and their recovery after restoration of binocular vision. In control animals with normal visual experience, the formation of presynaptic boutons increased during the critical period and then declined. MD affected bouton formation, but with a delay, blocking it after 3 d. These findings reveal intracortical anatomical changes in cellular layers of the cortex that can account for rapid activity-dependent plasticity.},

  abstract     = {Electrical stimulation is a highly-effective, temporally-precise technique to evoke neural activity in the brain, and thus is critically important for both research and clinical applications. Here, we set out to understand the time-course and spatial spread of neural activation elicited by electrical stimulation. By imaging the cortex of awake, chronically-implanted, transgenic mice during electrical stimulation, we found that a broad range of stimulation parameters led to widespread neural activation. In general, increasing current amplitude and the number of stimulation pulses progressively produced higher maximum activity and activated larger areas of cortex. However, increasing stimulation frequency above 30 Hz primarily shifted the timing, not amplitude, of peak activity. Our results demonstrate that even weak electrical stimulation widely activates neurons within awake mouse cortex.},

The transplant might induce OD plasticity in the host circuitry or might instead construct a parallel circuit of its own to suppress cortical responses to the deprived eye. We transplanted MGE neurons expressing either archaerhodopsin or channelrhodopsin into the visual cortex of both male and female mice, closed one eyelid for 4-5 d, and, as expected, observed transplant-induced OD plasticity. This plasticity was evident even when the activity of the transplanted cells was suppressed or enhanced optogenetically, demonstrating that the plasticity was produced by changes in the host visual cortex.  Interneuron transplantation into mouse V1 creates a window of heightened plasticity that is quantitatively and qualitatively similar to the normal critical period; that is, short-term occlusion of either eye markedly changes ocular dominance (OD). The underlying mechanism of this process is not known. Transplanted interneurons might either form a separate circuit to maintain the OD shift or might instead trigger changes in the host circuity. We designed experiments to distinguish the two hypotheses. Our findings suggest that while inhibition produced by the transplanted cells triggers this form of plasticity, the host circuity is entirely responsible for maintaining the OD shift.},

  abstract        = {The maturation of GABAergic inhibitory circuits is necessary for the onset of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) in the postnatal visual cortex (Hensch, 2005; Espinosa and Stryker, 2012). When it is deficient, the critical period does not start. When inhibitory maturation or signaling is precocious, it induces a precocious critical period. Heterochronic transplantation of GABAergic interneuron precursors derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) can induce a second period of functional plasticity in the visual cortex (Southwell et al., 2010). Although the timing of MGE transplantation-induced plasticity is dictated by the maturation of the transplanted cells, its mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we sought to test the effect of blocking vesicular GABA loading and subsequent release by transplanted interneurons on the ability to migrate, integrate, and induce plasticity in the host circuitry. We show that MGE cells taken from male and female donors that lack vesicular GABA transporter ( ) expression disperse and differentiate into somatostatin- and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons upon heterochronic transplantation in the postnatal mouse cortex. Although transplanted   mutant interneurons come to express mature interneuron markers and display electrophysiological properties similar to those of control cells, their morphology is significantly more complex. Significantly,   mutant MGE transplants fail to induce ODP, demonstrating the pivotal role of vesicular GABAergic transmission for MGE transplantation-induced plasticity in the postnatal mouse visual cortex.  Embryonic inhibitory neurons thrive when transplanted into postnatal brains, migrating and differentiating in the host as they would have done if left in the donor. Once integrated into the host, these new neurons can have profound effects. For example, in the visual cortex, such neurons induce a second critical period of activity-dependent plasticity when they reach the appropriate stage of development. The cellular mechanism by which these transplanted GABAergic interneurons induce plasticity is unknown. Here, we show that transplanted interneurons that are unable to fill synaptic vesicles with GABA migrate and integrate into the host circuit, but they do not induce a second period of plasticity. These data suggest a role for the vesicular GABA transporter in transplantation-mediated plasticity.},

We introduce a stimulus class-visual flow patterns-that is more like what the mouse would encounter in the natural world than are sine-wave gratings but is more tractable for analysis than are natural images. We used 128-site silicon microelectrodes to measure the simultaneous responses of single neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of alert mice. While holding temporal-frequency content fixed, we explored a class of drifting patterns of black or white dots that have energy only at higher spatial frequencies. These flow stimuli evoke strong visually mediated responses well beyond those predicted by spatial-frequency analysis. Flow responses predominate in higher spatial-frequency ranges (0.15-1.6 cycles per degree), many are orientation or direction selective, and flow responses of many neurons depend strongly on sign of contrast. Many cells exhibit distributed responses across our stimulus ensemble. Together, these results challenge conventional linear approaches to visual processing and expand our understanding of the mouse's visual capacity to behaviorally relevant ranges.},

Here, we investigated whether repeated exposure to specific stimuli would enhance V1 visual responses in mice using intrinsic signal imaging through the intact skull and two-photon imaging of calcium signals in single neurons. Mice ran on Styrofoam balls floating on air while viewing one of three different, high-contrast visual stimuli. V1 responses to the stimuli that were viewed by the animal were specifically enhanced, while responses to other stimuli were unaffected. Similar exposure in stationary mice or in mice in which NMDA receptors were partially blocked did not significantly enhance responses. These findings indicate that stimulus-specific plasticity in the adult visual cortex depends on concurrent locomotion, presumably as a result of the high-gain state of the visual cortex induced by locomotion.  We report a rapid and persistent increase in visual cortical responses to visual stimuli presented during locomotion in intact mice. We first used a method that is completely noninvasive to image intrinsic signals through the intact skull. We then measured the same effects on single neurons using two-photon calcium imaging and found that the increase in response to a particular stimulus produced by locomotion depends on how well the neuron is initially driven by the stimulus. To our knowledge, this is the first time such enhancement has been described in single neurons or using noninvasive measurements.},

  abstract        = {Interneuron precursors transplanted into visual cortex induce network plasticity during their heterochronic maturation. Such plasticity can have a significant impact on the function of the animal and is normally present only during a brief critical period in early postnatal development. Elucidating the synaptic and physiological properties of interneuron precursors as they mature is key to understanding how long-term circuit changes are induced by transplants. We studied the development of transplant-derived interneurons and compared it to endogenously developing interneurons (those that are born and develop in the same animal) at parallel developmental time points, using patch-clamp recordings in acute cortical slices. We found that transplant-derived interneurons develop into fast-spiking and non-fast-spiking neurons characteristic of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) lineage. Transplant-derived interneurons matured more rapidly than endogenously developing interneurons, as shown by more hyperpolarized membrane potentials, smaller input resistances, and narrower action potentials at a juvenile age. In addition, transplant-derived fast-spiking interneurons have more quickly saturating input-output relationships and lower maximal firing rates in adulthood, indicating a possible divergence in function. Transplant-derived interneurons both form inhibitory synapses onto host excitatory neurons and receive excitatory synapses from host pyramidal cells. Unitary connection properties are similar to those of host interneurons. These transplant-derived interneurons, however, were less densely functionally connected onto host pyramidal cells than were host interneurons and received fewer spontaneous excitatory inputs from host cells. These findings suggest that many physiological characteristics of interneurons are autonomously determined, while some factors impacting their circuit function may be influenced by the environment in which they develop.  Transplanting embryonic interneurons into older brains induces a period of plasticity in the recipient animal. We find that these interneurons develop typical fast-spiking and non-fast-spiking phenotypes by the end of adolescence. However, the input-output characteristics of transplant-derived neurons diverged from endogenously developing interneurons during adulthood, and they showed lower connection rates to local pyramidal cells at all time points. This suggests a unique and ongoing role of transplant-derived interneurons in host circuits, enabling interneuron transplant therapies.},

  abstract        = {Neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) are selective for particular properties of visual stimuli. Locomotion causes a change in cortical state that leaves their selectivity unchanged but strengthens their responses. Both locomotion and the change in cortical state are thought to be initiated by projections from the mesencephalic locomotor region, the latter through a disinhibitory circuit in V1. By recording simultaneously from a large number of single neurons in alert mice viewing moving gratings, we investigated the relationship between locomotion and the information contained within the neural population. We found that locomotion improved encoding of visual stimuli in V1 by two mechanisms. First, locomotion-induced increases in firing rates enhanced the mutual information between visual stimuli and single neuron responses over a fixed window of time. Second, stimulus discriminability was improved, even for fixed population firing rates, because of a decrease in noise correlations across the population. These two mechanisms contributed differently to improvements in discriminability across cortical layers, with changes in firing rates most important in the upper layers and changes in noise correlations most important in layer V. Together, these changes resulted in a threefold to fivefold reduction in the time needed to precisely encode grating direction and orientation. These results support the hypothesis that cortical state shifts during locomotion to accommodate an increased load on the visual system when mice are moving.  This paper contains three novel findings about the representation of information in neurons within the primary visual cortex of the mouse. First, we show that locomotion reduces by at least a factor of 3 the time needed for information to accumulate in the visual cortex that allows the distinction of different visual stimuli. Second, we show that the effect of locomotion is to increase information in cells of all layers of the visual cortex. Third, we show that the means by which information is enhanced by locomotion differs between the upper layers, where the major effect is the increasing of firing rates, and in layer V, where the major effect is the reduction in noise correlations.},

  abstract        = {Hebbian plasticity is widely considered to be the mechanism by which information can be coded and retained in neurons in the brain. Homeostatic plasticity moves the neuron back towards its original state following a perturbation, including perturbations produced by Hebbian plasticity. How then does homeostatic plasticity avoid erasing the Hebbian coded information? To understand how plasticity works in the brain, and therefore to understand learning, memory, sensory adaptation, development and recovery from injury, requires development of a theory of plasticity that integrates both forms of plasticity into a whole. In April 2016, a group of computational and experimental neuroscientists met in London at a discussion meeting hosted by the Royal Society to identify the critical questions in the field and to frame the research agenda for the next steps. Here, we provide a brief introduction to the papers arising from the meeting and highlight some of the themes to have emerged from the discussions.This article is part of the themed issue 'Integrating Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity'.},

We recently showed that the heterochronic transplantation of parvalbumin (PV) or somatostatin (SST) interneurons from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) reactivates ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) in the postnatal mouse visual cortex. Might other types of interneurons similarly induce cortical plasticity? Here, we establish that caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE)-derived interneurons, when transplanted into the visual cortex of neonatal mice, migrate extensively in the host brain and acquire laminar distribution, marker expression, electrophysiological properties, and visual response properties like those of host CGE interneurons. Although transplants from the anatomical CGE do induce ODP, we found that this plasticity reactivation is mediated by a small fraction of MGE-derived cells contained in the transplant. These findings demonstrate that transplanted CGE cells can successfully engraft into the postnatal mouse brain and confirm the unique role of MGE lineage neurons in the induction of ODP.},

Molecular cues and neuronal activity both play critical roles in map formation, but their interaction remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that when molecular- and activity-dependent cues are rendered nearly equal in force, they drive topographic mapping stochastically. The functional and anatomical representation of azimuth in the superior colliculus of heterozygous Islet2-EphA3 knockin (Isl2(EphA3/+)) mice is variable: maps may be single, duplicated, or a combination of the two. This heterogeneity is not due to genetic differences, since map organizations in individual mutant animals often differ between colliculi. Disruption of spontaneous waves of retinal activity resulted in uniform map organization in Isl2(EphA3/+) mice, demonstrating that correlated spontaneous activity is required for map heterogeneity. Computational modeling replicates this heterogeneity, revealing that molecular- and activity-dependent forces interact simultaneously and stochastically during topographic map formation.},

In most existing models, each form of plasticity directly modifies synaptic strength. Equilibrium is reached when the two are inducing equal and opposite changes. We show that such models cannot reproduce ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) because negative feedback from the slow homeostatic plasticity observed in ODP cannot stabilize the positive feedback of fast Hebbian plasticity. We propose a model in which synaptic strength is the product of a synapse-specific Hebbian factor and a postsynaptic-cell-specific homeostatic factor, with each factor separately arriving at a stable inactive state. This model captures ODP dynamics and has plausible biophysical substrates. We confirm model predictions experimentally that plasticity is inactive at stable states and that synaptic strength overshoots during recovery from visual deprivation. These results highlight the importance of multiple regulatory pathways for interactions of plasticity mechanisms operating over separate timescales.},

We recently have shown that transplantation of GABAergic precursors from the embryonic medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), the source of neocortical parvalbumin- (PV(+)) and somatostatin-expressing (SST(+)) interneurons, can induce a new period of ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) after the endogenous period has closed. Among the diverse subtypes of GABAergic interneurons PV(+) cells have been thought to play the crucial role in ODP. Here we have used MGE transplantation carrying a conditional allele of diphtheria toxin alpha subunit and cell-specific expression of Cre recombinase to deplete PV(+) or SST(+) interneurons selectively and to investigate the contributions of each of these types of interneurons to ODP. As expected, robust plasticity was observed in transplants containing PV(+) cells but in which the majority of SST(+) interneurons were depleted. Surprisingly, transplants in which the majority of PV(+) cells were depleted induced plasticity as effectively as those containing PV(+) cells. In contrast, depleting both cell types blocked induction of plasticity. These findings reveal that PV(+) cells do not play an exclusive role in ODP; SST(+) interneurons also can drive cortical plasticity and contribute to the reshaping of neural networks. The ability of both PV(+) and SST(+) interneurons to induce de novo cortical plasticity could help develop new therapeutic approaches for brain repair.},

In the cerebral cortex, inhibition is mediated largely by GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-secreting) interneurons, a cell type that originates in the embryonic ventral telencephalon and populates the cortex through long-distance tangential migration. Remarkably, when transplanted from embryos or in vitro culture preparations, immature interneurons disperse and integrate into host brain circuits, both in the cerebral cortex and in other regions of the central nervous system. These features make interneuron transplantation a powerful tool for the study of neurodevelopmental processes such as cell specification, cell death, and cortical plasticity. Moreover, interneuron transplantation provides a novel strategy for modifying neural circuits in rodent models of epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, mood disorders, and chronic pain.},

  abstract        = {Neurons in the visual cortex were first found to be exquisitely selective for particular properties of visual stimuli in anesthetized animals, including mice. Studies of alert mice in an apparatus that allowed them to stand or run revealed that locomotion causes a change in cortical state that dramatically increases the magnitude of responses in neurons of the visual cortex without altering selectivity, effectively changing the gain of sensory responses. Locomotion also dramatically enhances adult plasticity in the recovery from long-term visual deprivation. We have studied the elements and operation of the neural circuit responsible for the enhancement of activity and shown that it enhances plasticity even in mice not free to run. The circuit consists of projections ascending from the midbrain locomotor region (MLR) to the basal forebrain, activating cholinergic and perhaps other projections to excite inhibitory interneurons expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in the visual cortex. VIP cells activated by locomotion inhibit interneurons that express somatostatin (SST), thereby disinhibiting the excitatory principal neurons and allowing them to respond more strongly to effective visual stimuli. These findings reveal in alert animals how the ascending reticular activating system described in anesthetized animals 50 years ago operates to control cortical state.},

  abstract        = {Hubel and Wiesel began the modern study of development and plasticity of primary visual cortex (V1), discovering response properties of cortical neurons that distinguished them from their inputs and that were arranged in a functional architecture. Their findings revealed an early innate period of development and a later critical period of dramatic experience-dependent plasticity. Recent studies have used rodents to benefit from biochemistry and genetics. The roles of spontaneous neural activity and molecular signaling in innate, experience-independent development have been clarified, as have the later roles of visual experience. Plasticity produced by monocular visual deprivation (MD) has been dissected into stages governed by distinct signaling mechanisms, some of whose molecular players are known. Many crucial questions remain, but new tools for perturbing cortical cells and measuring plasticity at the level of changes in connections among identified neurons now exist. The future for the study of V1 to illuminate cortical development and plasticity is bright.},

  abstract        = {Sensory experience in early postnatal life shapes neuronal connections in the brain. Here we report that the local synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in dendrites plays an important role in this process. We found that dendritic spines of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the visual cortex in mutant mice lacking dendritic Bdnf mRNA and thus local BDNF synthesis were normal at 3 weeks of age, but thinner, longer, and more closely spaced (morphological features of immaturity) at 4 months of age than in wild-type (WT) littermates. Layer 2/3 of the visual cortex in these mutant animals also had fewer GABAergic presynaptic terminals at both ages. The overall size and shape of dendritic arbors were, however, similar in mutant and WT mice at both ages. By using optical imaging of intrinsic signals and single-unit recordings, we found that mutant animals failed to recover cortical responsiveness following monocular deprivation (MD) during the critical period, although they displayed normally the competitive loss of responsiveness to an eye briefly deprived of vision. Furthermore, MD still induced a loss of responsiveness to the closed eye in adult mutant mice, but not in adult WT mice. These results indicate that dendritic BDNF synthesis is required for spine pruning, late-phase spine maturation, and recovery of cortical responsiveness following sensory deprivation. They also suggest that maturation of dendritic spines is required for the maintenance of cortical responsiveness following sensory deprivation in adulthood.},

  abstract        = {Neuroplasticity can be defined as the ability of the nervous system to respond to intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli by reorganizing its structure, function and connections. Major advances in the understanding of neuroplasticity have to date yielded few established interventions. To advance the translation of neuroplasticity research towards clinical applications, the National Institutes of Health Blueprint for Neuroscience Research sponsored a workshop in 2009. Basic and clinical researchers in disciplines from central nervous system injury/stroke, mental/addictive disorders, paediatric/developmental disorders and neurodegeneration/ageing identified cardinal examples of neuroplasticity, underlying mechanisms, therapeutic implications and common denominators. Promising therapies that may enhance training-induced cognitive and motor learning, such as brain stimulation and neuropharmacological interventions, were identified, along with questions of how best to use this body of information to reduce human disability. Improved understanding of adaptive mechanisms at every level, from molecules to synapses, to networks, to behaviour, can be gained from iterative collaborations between basic and clinical researchers. Lessons can be gleaned from studying fields related to plasticity, such as development, critical periods, learning and response to disease. Improved means of assessing neuroplasticity in humans, including biomarkers for predicting and monitoring treatment response, are needed. Neuroplasticity occurs with many variations, in many forms, and in many contexts. However, common themes in plasticity that emerge across diverse central nervous system conditions include experience dependence, time sensitivity and the importance of motivation and attention. Integration of information across disciplines should enhance opportunities for the translation of neuroplasticity and circuit retraining research into effective clinical therapies.},

Here, we take the complementary approach of using a genetic gain-of-function that enhances plasticity. We show that a constitutively active form of H-ras (H-ras(G12V)), expressed presynaptically at excitatory synapses in mice, accelerates and enhances multiple, mechanistically distinct forms of plasticity in the developing visual cortex. In vivo, H-ras(G12V) not only increased the rate of ocular dominance change in response to monocular deprivation (MD), but also accelerated recovery from deprivation by reverse occlusion. In vitro, H-ras(G12V) expression decreased baseline presynaptic release probability and enhanced presynaptically expressed long-term potentiation (LTP). H-ras(G12V) expression also accelerated the increase following MD in the frequency of miniature excitatory potentials, mirroring accelerated plasticity in vivo. These findings demonstrate accelerated neocortical plasticity, which offers an avenue toward future therapies for many neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.},

We investigated the role of the maternally expressed Ube3a gene in experience-dependent development and plasticity of the mouse visual system. As demonstrated by optical imaging, rapid ocular dominance (OD) plasticity after brief monocular deprivation (MD) was severely impaired during the critical period (CP) in the visual cortex (VC) of Ube3a maternal-deficient (m-/p+) mice. Prolonged MD elicited significant plasticity in m-/p+ mice that never matched the level seen in control animals. In older animals after the CP, 7-day MD elicited mild OD shifts in both control and m-/p+ mice; however, the OD shifts in m-/p+ mice lacked the strengthening of visual responses to the two eyes characteristic of normal adult plasticity. Anatomic effects of the maternal deficiency include reduced spine density on basal, but not apical, dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the binocular region of the VC. Imprinting of Ube3a expression was not fully established in the early postnatal period, consistent with the normal development of cortical retinotopy and visual acuity that we observed in m-/p+ mice, but was fully established by the onset of the CP. These results demonstrate that paternal and maternal genomes are not functionally equivalent for cortical plasticity, and that maternally expressed Ube3a is required for normal experience-dependent modification of cortical circuits during and after the CP.},

During a critical period in the postnatal development of the visual cortex, the occlusion of one eye triggers a rapid reorganization of neuronal responses, a process known as ocular dominance plasticity. We have shown that the transplantation of inhibitory neurons induces ocular dominance plasticity after the critical period. Transplanted inhibitory neurons receive excitatory synapses, make inhibitory synapses onto host cortical neurons, and promote plasticity when they reach a cellular age equivalent to that of endogenous inhibitory neurons during the normal critical period. These findings suggest that ocular dominance plasticity is regulated by the execution of a maturational program intrinsic to inhibitory neurons.

  abstract        = {The volume of health science publications is escalating rapidly. Thus, keeping up with developments is becoming harder as is the task of finding important cross-domain connections. When geographic location is a relevant component of research reported in publications, these tasks are more difficult because standard search and indexing facilities have limited or no ability to identify geographic foci in documents. This paper introduces HEALTH GeoJunction, a web application that supports researchers in the task of quickly finding scientific publications that are relevant geographically and temporally as well as thematically. HEALTH GeoJunction is a geovisual analytics-enabled web application providing: (a) web services using computational reasoning methods to extract place-time-concept information from bibliographic data for documents and (b) visually-enabled place-time-concept query, filtering, and contextualizing tools that apply to both the documents and their extracted content. This paper focuses specifically on strategies for visually-enabled, iterative, facet-like, place-time-concept filtering that allows analysts to quickly drill down to scientific findings of interest in PubMed abstracts and to explore relations among abstracts and extracted concepts in place and time. The approach enables analysts to: find publications without knowing all relevant query parameters, recognize unanticipated geographic relations within and among documents in multiple health domains, identify the thematic emphasis of research targeting particular places, notice changes in concepts over time, and notice changes in places where concepts are emphasized. PubMed is a database of over 19 million biomedical abstracts and citations maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information; achieving quick filtering is an important contribution due to the database size. Including geography in filters is important due to rapidly escalating attention to geographic factors in public health. The implementation of mechanisms for iterative place-time-concept filtering makes it possible to narrow searches efficiently and quickly from thousands of documents to a small subset that meet place-time-concept constraints. Support for a more-like-this query creates the potential to identify unexpected connections across diverse areas of research. Multi-view visualization methods support understanding of the place, time, and concept components of document collections and enable comparison of filtered query results to the full set of publications.},

  abstract        = {Ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) following monocular deprivation (MD) is a model of activity-dependent neural plasticity that is restricted to an early critical period regulated by maturation of inhibition. Unique developmental plasticity mechanisms may improve outcomes following early brain injury. Our objective was to determine the effects of neonatal cerebral hypoxia-ischemia (HI) on ODP. The rationale extends from observations that neonatal HI results in death of subplate neurons, a transient population known to influence development of inhibition. In rodents subjected to neonatal HI and controls, maps of visual response were derived from optical imaging during the critical period for ODP and changes in the balance of eye-specific response following MD were measured. In controls, MD results in a shift of the ocular dominance index (ODI) from a baseline of 0.15 to -0.10 (p < 0.001). Neonatal HI with moderate cortical injury impairs this shift, ODI = 0.14 (p < 0.01). Plasticity was intact in animals with mild injury and in those exposed to hypoxia alone. Neonatal HI resulted in decreased parvalbumin expression in hemispheres receiving HI compared with hypoxia alone: 23.4 versus 35.0 cells/high-power field (p = 0.01), with no change in other markers of inhibitory or excitatory neurons. Despite abnormal inhibitory neuron phenotype, spontaneous activity of single units and development of orientation selective responses were intact following neonatal HI, while overall visual responses were reduced. Our data suggest that specific plasticity mechanisms are impaired following early brain injury and that the impairment is associated with altered inhibitory neuronal development and cortical activation.},

In the visual system, the superior colliculus receives topographic projections from the retina and primary visual cortex (V1) that are aligned. Alignment may be achieved through the use of a gradient of shared axon guidance molecules, or through a retinal-matching mechanism in which axons that monitor identical regions of visual space align. To distinguish between these possibilities, we take advantage of genetically engineered mice that we show have a duplicated functional retinocollicular map but only a single map in V1. Anatomical tracing revealed that the corticocollicular projection bifurcates to align with the duplicated retinocollicular map in a manner dependent on the normal pattern of spontaneous activity during development. These data suggest a general model in which convergent maps use coincident activity patterns to achieve alignment.},

Although the visual cortex of adult rodents retains a capacity for plasticity in response to monocular visual deprivation, the nature of this plasticity and the neural circuit changes that accompany it remain enigmatic. Here, we investigate differences between adult and juvenile ocular dominance plasticity using Fourier optical imaging of intrinsic signals in mouse visual cortex. This comparison reveals that adult plasticity takes longer than in the juvenile mouse, is of smaller magnitude, has a greater contribution from the increase in response to the open eye, and has less effect on the hemisphere ipsilateral to the deprived eye. Binocular deprivation also causes different changes in the adult. Adult plasticity is similar to juvenile plasticity in its dependence on signaling through NMDA receptors. We propose that adult ocular dominance plasticity arises from compensatory mechanisms that counterbalance the loss of afferent activity caused by visual deprivation.},

However, the visual cortex, in which sensory coding has been most thoroughly studied in other species, has essentially been neglected in mice perhaps because of their poor spatial acuity and the lack of columnar organization such as orientation maps. We have now applied quantitative methods to characterize visual receptive fields in mouse primary visual cortex V1 by making extracellular recordings with silicon electrode arrays in anesthetized mice. We used current source density analysis to determine laminar location and spike waveforms to discriminate putative excitatory and inhibitory units. We find that, although the spatial scale of mouse receptive fields is up to one or two orders of magnitude larger, neurons show selectivity for stimulus parameters such as orientation and spatial frequency that is near to that found in other species. Furthermore, typical response properties such as linear versus nonlinear spatial summation (i.e., simple and complex cells) and contrast-invariant tuning are also present in mouse V1 and correlate with laminar position and cell type. Interestingly, we find that putative inhibitory neurons generally have less selective, and nonlinear, responses. This quantitative description of receptive field properties should facilitate the use of mouse visual cortex as a system to address longstanding questions of visual neuroscience and cortical processing.},

The development of retinocollicular maps depend on a combination of molecular guidance cues and patterned neural activity. Here, we characterize the functional retinocollicular maps in mice lacking the guidance molecules ephrin-A2, -A3, and -A5 and in mice deficient in both ephrin-As and structured spontaneous retinal activity, using a method of Fourier imaging of intrinsic signals. We find that the SC of ephrin-A2/A3/A5 triple knock-out mice contains functional maps that are disrupted selectively along the nasotemporal (azimuth) axis of the visual space. These maps are discontinuous, with patches of SC responding to topographically incorrect locations. The patches disappear in mice that are deficient in both ephrin-As and structured activity, resulting in a near-absence of azimuth map in the SC. These results indicate that ephrin-As guide the formation of functional topography in the SC, and patterned retinal activity clusters cells based on their correlated firing patterns. Comparison of the SC and visual cortical mapping defects in these mice suggests that although ephrin-As are required for mapping in both SC and visual cortex, ephrin-A-independent mapping mechanisms are more important in visual cortex than in the SC.},

This experience-dependent plasticity is disrupted by reductions of intracortical inhibition. Little is known about how the responses of inhibitory cells themselves change during plasticity. We investigated the time course of inhibitory cell plasticity in mouse primary visual cortex by using functional two-photon microscopy with single-cell resolution and genetic identification of cell type. Initially, local inhibitory and excitatory cells had similar binocular visual response properties, both favoring the contralateral eye. After 2 days of monocular visual deprivation, excitatory cell responses shifted to favor the open eye, whereas inhibitory cells continued to respond more strongly to the deprived eye. By 4 days of deprivation, inhibitory cell responses shifted to match the faster changes in their excitatory counterparts. These findings reveal a dramatic delay in inhibitory cell plasticity. A minimal linear model reveals that the delay in inhibitory cell plasticity potently accelerates Hebbian plasticity in neighboring excitatory neurons. These findings offer a network-level explanation as to how inhibition regulates the experience-dependent plasticity of neocortex.},

After monocular visual deprivation, the reduction in response of binocular neurons to one eye is matched by a corresponding increase to the other. Chronic optical imaging in mice deficient in TNFalpha reveals the normal initial loss of deprived-eye responses, but the subsequent increase in response to the open eye is absent. This mutation also blocks homeostatic synaptic scaling of mEPSCs in visual cortex in vitro, without affecting LTP. In monocular cortex, thought not to be subject to competition, responses in TNFalpha mutants are as reduced as in the binocular zone. Pharmacological inhibition of endogenous TNFalpha in wild-type mice phenocopies the knockout. These findings suggest that experience-dependent competition in developing visual cortex is the outcome of two distinct, noncompetitive processes, a loss of deprived-eye responses followed by an apparently homeostatic increase in responses dependent on TNFalpha signaling.},

Neural responses are commonly characterized by a linear-nonlinear (LN) model, in which the output of a linear filter applied to the stimulus is transformed by a static nonlinearity to determine neural response. To estimate the linear filter in the LN model, studies of responses to natural stimuli commonly use methods that are unbiased only for a linear model (in which there is no static nonlinearity): spike-triggered averages with correction for stimulus power spectrum, with or without regularization. Although these methods work well for artificial stimuli, such as Gaussian white noise, we show here that they estimate neural filters of LN models from responses to natural stimuli much more poorly. We studied simple cells in cat primary visual cortex. We demonstrate that the filters computed by directly taking the nonlinearity into account have better predictive power and depend less on the stimulus than those computed under the linear model. With noise stimuli, filters computed using the linear and LN models were similar, as predicted theoretically. With natural stimuli, filters of the two models can differ profoundly. Noise and natural stimulus filters differed significantly in spatial properties, but these differences were exaggerated when filters were computed using the linear rather than the LN model. Although regularization of filters computed under the linear model improved their predictive power, it also led to systematic distortions of their spatial frequency profiles, especially at low spatial and temporal frequencies.},

It has been thought that the deprived-eye pathway will fail to compete against the open-eye pathway for limited amounts of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which acts on TrkB and is needed to sustain effective synaptic connections. We tested this model by using a chemical-genetic approach in mice to inhibit TrkB kinase activity rapidly and specifically during the induction of cortical plasticity in vivo. Contrary to the model, TrkB kinase activity was not required for any of the effects of monocular deprivation. When the deprived eye was re-opened during the critical period, cortical responses to it recovered. This recovery was blocked by TrkB inhibition. These findings suggest a more conventional trophic role for TrkB signaling in the enhancement of responses or growth of new connections, rather than a role in competition.},

We have previously shown that precise mapping of thalamocortical projections requires both molecular cues and structured retinal activity. To probe the interaction between these two mechanisms, we studied mice deficient in both ephrin-As and retinal waves. Functional and anatomical cortical maps in these mice were nearly abolished along the nasotemporal (azimuth) axis of the visual space. Both the structure of single-cell receptive fields and large-scale topography were severely distorted. These results demonstrate that ephrin-As and structured neuronal activity are two distinct pathways that mediate map formation in the visual cortex and together account almost completely for the formation of the azimuth map. Despite the dramatic disruption of azimuthal topography, the dorsoventral (elevation) map was relatively normal, indicating that the two axes of the cortical map are organized by separate mechanisms.},

Consistent with this functional independence of channels, we demonstrate here that on- and off-center geniculate afferents segregate in different domains of the cat primary visual cortex and that off responses dominate the cortical representation of the area centralis. On average, 70% of the geniculate afferents converging at the same cortical domain had receptive fields of the same contrast polarity. Moreover, off-center afferents dominated the representation of the area centralis in the cortex, but not in the thalamus, indicating that on- and off-center afferents are balanced in number, but not in the amount of cortical territory that they cover.},

ON responses are thought to originate by exclusive use of metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR6) expressed in retinal ON bipolar cells. Paradoxically, we find ON responses in retinal ganglion cells of mGluR6-null mice, but they occur at long latency. The long-latency ON responses are not blocked by metabotropic glutamate or cholinergic receptor antagonists and are not produced by activation of receptive field surrounds. We show that these longer-latency ON responses are initiated in the OFF pathways. Our results expose a previously unrecognized intrinsic property of OFF retinal pathways that generates responses to light onset. In mGluR6-null mice, long-latency ON responses are observed in the visual cortex, indicating that they can be conducted reliably to higher visual areas. In wild-type (WT) mice, APB (DL-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid), an mGluR6 agonist, blocks normal, short-latency ON responses but unmasks longer-latency ones. We find that these potentially confusing ON responses in the OFF pathway are actively suppressed in WT mice via two pharmacologically separable retinal circuits that are activated by the ON system in the retina. Consequently, we propose that a major function of the signaling of the ON pathway to the OFF pathway is suppression of these mistimed, and therefore inappropriate, light-evoked responses.},

V1 is shifted medially, rotated, and compressed and its internal organization is degraded. Expressing ephrin-A5 ectopically by in utero electroporation in the lateral cortex shifts the map of V1 medially, and expression within V1 disrupts its internal organization. These findings indicate that interactions between gradients of EphA/ephrin-A in the cortex guide map formation, but that factors other than redundant ephrin-As are responsible for the remnant map. Together with earlier work on the retinogeniculate map, the current findings show that the same molecular interactions may operate at successive stages of the visual pathway to organize maps.},

A major theory of alphaCaMKII function proposes that autophosphorylation of the molecule mediates not only the induction but also the maintenance of synaptic plasticity. To test this hypothesis, we assessed ocular dominance plasticity in genetically engineered mice that carry a mutation preventing autophosphorylation of alphaCaMKII. These mutant mice are deficient in plasticity after monocular deprivation, but a sufficiently long period of monocular deprivation will induce ocular dominance plasticity. After induction of ocular dominance plasticity, the stability of the induced changes was assayed after binocular deprivation. Plasticity in homozygous mutant animals was as stable as that measured in WT littermates; also, response characteristics did not differ between the two groups. Our results suggest that alphaCaMKII autophosphorylation is required for the induction of ocular dominance plasticity but is not needed for its stable maintenance thereafter.},

In order to assess whether the brain's coding strategy depends on the stimulus ensemble, we apply a new information-theoretic method that allows unbiased calculation of neural filters (receptive fields) from responses to natural scenes or other complex signals with strong multipoint correlations. In the cat primary visual cortex we compare responses to natural inputs with those to noise inputs matched for luminance and contrast. We find that neural filters adaptively change with the input ensemble so as to increase the information carried by the neural response about the filtered stimulus. Adaptation affects the spatial frequency composition of the filter, enhancing sensitivity to under-represented frequencies in agreement with optimal encoding arguments. Adaptation occurs over 40 s to many minutes, longer than most previously reported forms of adaptation.},

  abstract        = {The responses of cells in the visual cortex to stimulation of the two eyes changes dramatically following a period of monocular visual deprivation (MD) during a critical period in early life. This phenomenon, referred to as ocular dominance (OD) plasticity, is a widespread model for understanding cortical plasticity. In this study, we designed stimulus patterns and quantification methods to analyze OD in the mouse visual cortex using optical imaging of intrinsic signals. Using periodically drifting bars restricted to the binocular portion of the visual field, we obtained cortical maps for both contralateral (C) and ipsilateral (I) eyes and computed OD maps as (C - I)/(C + I). We defined the OD index (ODI) for individual animals as the mean of the OD map. The ODI obtained from an imaging session of less than 30 min gives reliable measures of OD for both normal and monocularly deprived mice under Nembutal anesthesia. Surprisingly, urethane anesthesia, which yields excellent topographic maps, did not produce consistent OD findings. Normal Nembutal-anesthetized mice have positive ODI (0.22 +/- 0.01), confirming a contralateral bias in the binocular zone. For mice monocularly deprived during the critical period, the ODI of the cortex contralateral to the deprived eye shifted negatively towards the nondeprived, ipsilateral eye (ODI after 2-day MD: 0.12 +/- 0.02, 4-day: 0.03 +/- 0.03, and 6- to 7-day MD: -0.01 +/- 0.04). The ODI shift induced by 4-day MD appeared to be near maximal, consistent with previous findings using single-unit recordings. We have thus established optical imaging of intrinsic signals as a fast and reliable screening method to study OD plasticity in the mouse.},

  abstract        = {Brain state fluctuations modulate sensory processing, but the factors governing state-dependent neural activity remain unclear. Here, we tracked the dynamics of cortical extracellular K  concentrations ([K ] ) during awake state transitions and manipulated [K ]  in slices, during visual processing, and during skilled motor execution. When mice transitioned from quiescence to locomotion, [K ]  increased by 0.6-1.0 mM in all cortical areas analyzed, and this preceded locomotion by 1 s. Emulating the state-dependent [K ]  increase in cortical slices caused neuronal depolarization and enhanced input-output transformation. In vivo, locomotion increased the gain of visually evoked responses in layer 2/3 of visual cortex; this effect was recreated by imposing a [K ]  increase. Elevating [K ]  in the motor cortex increased movement-induced neuronal spiking in layer 5 and improved motor performance. Thus, [K ]  increases in a cortex-wide state-dependent manner, and this [K ]  increase affects both sensory and motor processing through the dynamic modulation of neural activity.},

  abstract     = {In the course of a day, brain states fluctuate, from conscious awake information-acquiring states to sleep states, during which previously acquired information is further processed and stored as memories. One hypothesis is that memories are consolidated and stored during "offline" states such as sleep, a process thought to involve transfer of information from the hippocampus to other cortical areas. Up and Down states (UDS), patterns of activity that occur under anesthesia and sleep states, are likely to play a role in this process, although the nature of this role remains unclear. Here we review what is currently known about these mechanisms in three anatomically distinct but interconnected cortical areas: somatosensory cortex, entorhinal cortex, and the hippocampus. In doing so, we consider the role of this activity in the coordination of "replay" during sleep states, particularly during hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. We conclude that understanding the generation and propagation of UDS may provide key insights into the cortico-hippocampal dialogue linking archi- and neocortical areas during memory formation.},

These characteristics suggest that L6b can strongly modulate brain state, but projections to L6b and their influence remain unknown. Here, we examine the inputs to L6b ex vivo in the mouse primary somatosensory cortex with rabies-based retrograde tracing and channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping in brain slices. We find that L6b receives its strongest excitatory input from intracortical long-range projection neurons, including those in the contralateral hemisphere. In contrast, local intracortical input and thalamocortical input were significantly weaker. Moreover, our data suggest that L6b receives far less thalamocortical input than other cortical layers. L6b was most strongly inhibited by PV and SST interneurons. This study shows that L6b integrates long-range intracortical information and is not part of the traditional thalamocortical loop.},

However, our knowledge of active dendrites has been almost entirely acquired from studies of rodents. In this work, we investigated the dendrites of layer 2 and 3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons of the human cerebral cortex ex vivo. In these neurons, we discovered a class of calcium-mediated dendritic action potentials (dCaAPs) whose waveform and effects on neuronal output have not been previously described. In contrast to typical all-or-none action potentials, dCaAPs were graded; their amplitudes were maximal for threshold-level stimuli but dampened for stronger stimuli. These dCaAPs enabled the dendrites of individual human neocortical pyramidal neurons to classify linearly nonseparable inputs-a computation conventionally thought to require multilayered networks.},

  abstract     = {In this review article, we highlight several disparate ideas that are linked to changes in brain state (i.e., sleep to arousal, Down to Up, synchronized to de-synchronized). In any discussion of the brain state, we propose that the cortical pyramidal neuron has a central position. EEG recordings, which typically assess brain state, predominantly reflect the activity of cortical pyramidal neurons. This means that the dominant rhythmic activity that characterizes a particular brain state ultimately has to manifest globally across the pyramidal neuron population. During state transitions, it is the long-range connectivity of these neurons that broadcast the resultant changes in activity to many subcortical targets. Structures like the thalamus, brainstem/hypothalamic neuromodulatory systems, and respiratory systems can also strongly influence brain state, and for many decades we have been uncovering bidirectional pathways that link these structures to state changes in the cerebral cortex. More recently, movement and active behaviors have emerged as powerful drivers of state changes. Each of these systems involve different circuits distributed across the brain. Yet, for a system-wide change in brain state, there must be a collaboration between these circuits that reflects and perhaps triggers the transition between brain states. As we expand our understanding of how brain state changes, our current challenge is to understand how these diverse sets of circuits and pathways interact to produce the changes observed in cortical pyramidal neurons.},

The mechanism for such selectiveness is unknown. Here we show that three different anesthetics have the same disruptive influence on signaling along apical dendrites in cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons in mice. We found that optogenetic depolarization of the distal apical dendrites caused robust spiking at the cell body under awake conditions that was blocked by anesthesia. Moreover, we found that blocking metabotropic glutamate and cholinergic receptors had the same effect on apical dendrite decoupling as anesthesia or inactivation of the higher-order thalamus. If feedback signaling occurs predominantly through apical dendrites, the cellular mechanism we found would explain not only how anesthesia selectively blocks this signaling but also why conscious perception depends on both cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical connectivity.},

With the vGATE method, we identified and permanently tagged a small subpopulation of OT cells, which, by optogenetic stimulation, strongly attenuated contextual fear-induced freezing, and pharmacogenetic silencing of tagged OT neurons impaired context-specific fear extinction, demonstrating that the tagged OT neurons are sufficient and necessary, respectively, to control contextual fear. Intriguingly, OT cell terminals of fear-experienced rats displayed enhanced glutamate release in the amygdala. Furthermore, rats exposed to another round of fear conditioning displayed 5-fold more activated magnocellular OT neurons in a novel environment than a familiar one, possibly for a generalized fear response. Thus, our results provide first evidence that hypothalamic OT neurons represent a fear memory engram.},

We show that (1) whisking asymmetry is coordinated with behavioral state, and that behavioral state can be decoded and predicted based on asymmetry, (2) even in the absence of tactile input, whisker positioning and asymmetry nevertheless relate to behavioral state, and (3) movement of the nose correlates with asymmetry, indicating that facial expression of the mouse is itself correlated with behavioral state. These results indicate that the movement of whiskers, a behavior that is not instructed or necessary in the task, can inform an observer about what a mouse is doing in the maze. Thus, the position of these mobile tactile sensors reflects a behavioral and movement-preparation state of the mouse.  Behavior is a sequence of movements, where each movement can be related to or can trigger a set of other actions. Here we show that, in mice, the movement of whiskers (tactile sensors used to extract information about texture and location of objects) is coordinated with and predicts the behavioral state of mice: that is, what mice are doing, where they are in space, and where they are in the sequence of behaviors.},

Interestingly, during puberty, the number of Scnn1a+ neurons roughly doubled within genital cortex. The increase of Scnn1a+ neurons was gradual and rapidly advanced by initial sexual experience. Neurons that gained Scnn1a expression comprised stellate and pyramidal neurons in layer 4. Unlike during neonatal development, pyramids did not retract their apical dendrites during puberty. Calcium imaging revealed stronger genital-touch responses in Scnn1a+ neurons in males versus females and a developmental increase in responsiveness in females. The first sexual interaction is a unique physical experience that often creates long-lasting memories. We suggest such experience uniquely alters somatosensory body maps.},

Over the last decades our ability to monitor activity in the brain, manipulate it while also manipulating the environment the animal moves through, has been tackled with increasing sophistication. However, our ability to track the movement of the animal in real time has not kept pace. Here, we use a dynamic vision sensor (DVS) based event-driven neuromorphic camera system to implement real-time, low-latency tracking of a single whisker that mice can move at ∼25 Hz. The customized DVS system described here converts whisker motion into a series of events that can be used to estimate the position of the whisker and to trigger a position-based output interactively within 2 ms. This neuromorphic chip-based closed-loop system provides feedback rapidly and flexibly. With this system, it becomes possible to use the movement of whiskers or in principal, movement of any part of the body to reward, punish, in a rapidly reconfigurable way. These methods can be used to manipulate behavior, and the neural circuits that help animals adapt to changing values of a sequence of motor actions.},

  abstract     = {One fundamental feature of consciousness is that the contents of consciousness depend on the state of consciousness. Here, we propose an answer to why this is so: both the state and the contents of consciousness depend on the activity of cortical layer 5 pyramidal (L5p) neurons. These neurons affect both cortical and thalamic processing, hence coupling the cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical loops with each other. Functionally this coupling corresponds to the coupling between the state and the contents of consciousness. Together the cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical loops form a thalamo-cortical broadcasting system, where the L5p cells are the central elements. This perspective makes one quite specific prediction: cortical processing that does not include L5p neurons will be unconscious. More generally, the present perspective suggests that L5p neurons have a central role in the mechanisms underlying consciousness.},

  abstract     = {The advent of optogenetic methods has made it possible to use endogeneously produced molecules to image and manipulate cellular, subcellular, and synaptic activity. It has also led to the development of photoactivatable calcium-dependent indicators that mark active synapses, neurons, and circuits. Furthermore, calcium-dependent photoactivation can be used to trigger gene expression in active neurons. Here we describe two sets of protocols, one using CaMPARI and a second one using Cal-Light. CaMPARI, a calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator, enables rapid network-wide, tunable, all-optical functional circuit mapping. Cal-Light, a photoactivatable calcium sensor, while slower to respond than CaMPARI, has the capacity to trigger the expression of genes, including effectors, activators, indicators, or other constructs. Here we describe the rationale and provide procedures for using these two calcium-dependent constructs (1)   in dissociated primary neuronal cell cultures (CaMPARI & Cal-Light); (2)   in acute brain slices for circuit mapping (CaMPARI); (3)   for triggering photoconversion or gene expression (CaMPARI & Cal-Light); and finally, (4) for recovering photoconverted neurons post-fixation with immunocytochemistry (CaMPARI). The approaches and protocols we describe are examples of the potential uses of both CaMPARI & Cal-Light. The ability to mark and manipulate neurons that are active during specific epochs of behavior has a vast unexplored experimental potential.},

We develop the perspective that cortical layering needs to be understood in terms of its functional anatomy, i.e., the terminations of synaptic inputs on distinct cellular compartments and their effect on cortical activity. The cortex is a hierarchical structure in which feed forward and feedback pathways have a layer-specific termination pattern. We take the view that the influence of synaptic inputs arriving at different cortical layers can only be understood in terms of their complex interaction with cellular biophysics and the subsequent computation that occurs at the cellular level. We use high-resolution fMRI, which can resolve activity across layers, as a case study for implementing this approach by describing how cognitive events arising from the laminar distribution of inputs can be interpreted by taking into account the properties of neurons that span different layers. This perspective is based on recent advances in measuring subcellular activity in distinct feed-forward and feedback axons and in dendrites as they span across layers.},

Calcium activity in dendrites is known to be necessary for structural plasticity changes, but this has never been carefully examined during sleep. Here, we report that calcium activity in populations of neocortical dendrites is increased and synchronised during oscillations in the spindle range in naturally sleeping rodents. Remarkably, the same relationship is not found in cell bodies of the same neurons and throughout the cortical column. Spindles during sleep have been suggested to be important for brain development and plasticity. Our results provide evidence for a physiological link of spindles in the cortex specific to dendrites, the main site of synaptic plasticity.Different stages of sleep, marked by particular electroencephalographic (EEG) signatures, have been linked to memory consolidation, but underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, the authors show that dendritic calcium synchronisation correlates with spindle-rich sleep phases.},

  abstract        = {The genetically encoded fluorescent calcium integrator calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiobetric integrator (CaMPARI) reports calcium influx induced by synaptic and neural activity. Its fluorescence is converted from green to red in the presence of violet light and calcium. The rate of conversion - the sensitivity to activity - is tunable and depends on the intensity of violet light. Synaptic activity and action potentials can independently initiate significant CaMPARI conversion. The level of conversion by subthreshold synaptic inputs is correlated to the strength of input, enabling optical readout of relative synaptic strength. When combined with optogenetic activation of defined presynaptic neurons, CaMPARI provides an all-optical method to map synaptic connectivity. The calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator (CaMPARI) is a genetically encoded calcium integrator that facilitates the study of neural circuits by permanently marking cells active during user-specified temporal windows. Permanent marking enables measurement of signals from large swathes of tissue and easy correlation of activity with other structural or functional labels. One potential application of CaMPARI is labelling neurons postsynaptic to specific populations targeted for optogenetic stimulation, giving rise to all-optical functional connectivity mapping. Here, we characterized the response of CaMPARI to several common types of neuronal calcium signals in mouse acute cortical brain slices. Our experiments show that CaMPARI is effectively converted by both action potentials and subthreshold synaptic inputs, and that conversion level is correlated to synaptic strength. Importantly, we found that conversion rate can be tuned: it is linearly related to light intensity. At low photoconversion light levels CaMPARI offers a wide dynamic range due to slower conversion rate; at high light levels conversion is more rapid and more sensitive to activity. Finally, we employed CaMPARI and optogenetics for functional circuit mapping in ex vivo acute brain slices, which preserve in vivo-like connectivity of axon terminals. With a single light source, we stimulated channelrhodopsin-2-expressing long-range posteromedial (POm) thalamic axon terminals in cortex and induced CaMPARI conversion in recipient cortical neurons. We found that POm stimulation triggers robust photoconversion of layer 5 cortical neurons and weaker conversion of layer 2/3 neurons. Thus, CaMPARI enables network-wide, tunable, all-optical functional circuit mapping that captures supra- and subthreshold depolarization.},

It takes advantage of an off-the-shelf camera system, the Pixy camera, designed as a fast vision sensor for robotics that uses a color-based filtering algorithm at 50 Hz to track objects. Using customized software, we demonstrate the versatility of our approach by first tracking the rostro-caudal motion of individual adjacent row (D1, D2) or arc whiskers (β, γ), or a single whisker and points on the whisker pad, in head-fixed mice performing a tactile task. Next, we acquired high-speed video and Pixy data simultaneously and applied the pixy-based real-time tracking to high-speed video data. With this approach, we expand the temporal resolution of the Pixy camera and track motion ( ) at the limit of high-speed video frame rates. Finally, we show that this system is flexible: it can be used to track individual whisker or limb position without any sophisticated object tracking algorithm, it can be used in many lighting conditions including infrared (IR); it can be used to track head rotation and location of multiple animals simultaneously. Our system makes behavioral monitoring possible in virtually any biological setting.},

  abstract        = {Cortical surface recording techniques such as EEG and ECoG are widely used for measuring brain activity. The prevailing assumption is that surface potentials primarily reflect synaptic activity, although non-synaptic events may also contribute. Here we show that dendritic calcium spikes occurring in pyramidal neurons (that we showed previously are cognitively relevant) are clearly detectable in cortical surface potentials. To show this we developed an optogenetic, non-synaptic approach to evoke dendritic calcium spikes in vivo. We found that optogenetically evoked calcium spikes were easily detectable and had an unexpected waveform near the cortical surface. Sensory-evoked dendritic calcium spikes were also clearly detectable with amplitudes that matched the contribution of synaptic input. These results reveal how dendritic calcium spikes appear at the cortical surface and their significant impact on surface potentials, suggesting that long-standing surface recording data may contain information about dendritic activity that is relevant to behavior and cognitive function.Surface EEG recordings are thought to primarily detect synaptic activity. Here the authors devise an optogenetic method to evoke dendritic calcium spikes in layer 5 pyramidal cells of the rat somatosensory cortex, and report that optogenetically evoked, as well as sensory-evoked dendritic calcium spikes make a significant contribution to surface EEG recordings.},

  abstract        = {Natural behavior occurs in multiple sensory and motor modalities and in particular is dependent on sensory feedback that constantly adjusts behavior. To investigate the underlying neuronal correlates of natural behavior, it is useful to have access to state-of-the-art recording equipment (e.g., 2-photon imaging, patch recordings, etc.) that frequently requires head fixation. This limitation has been addressed with various approaches such as virtual reality/air ball or treadmill systems. However, achieving multimodal realistic behavior in these systems can be challenging. These systems are often also complex and expensive to implement. Here we present "Air-Track," an easy-to-build head-fixed behavioral environment that requires only minimal computational processing. The Air-Track is a lightweight physical maze floating on an air table that has all the properties of the "real" world, including multiple sensory modalities tightly coupled to motor actions. To test this system, we trained mice in Go/No-Go and two-alternative forced choice tasks in a plus maze. Mice chose lanes and discriminated apertures or textures by moving the Air-Track back and forth and rotating it around themselves. Mice rapidly adapted to moving the track and used visual, auditory, and tactile cues to guide them in performing the tasks. A custom-controlled camera system monitored animal location and generated data that could be used to calculate reaction times in the visual and somatosensory discrimination tasks. We conclude that the Air-Track system is ideal for eliciting natural behavior in concert with virtually any system for monitoring or manipulating brain activity.},

However, despite its clinical prevalence, very little is known about the action of TMS at the cellular level let alone what effect it might have at the subcellular level (e.g. dendrites). Here, we examine the effect of single-pulse TMS on dendritic activity in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex using an optical fiber imaging approach. We find that TMS causes GABAB-mediated inhibition of sensory-evoked dendritic Ca(2+) activity. We conclude that TMS directly activates fibers within the upper cortical layers that leads to the activation of dendrite-targeting inhibitory neurons which in turn suppress dendritic Ca(2+) activity. This result implies a specificity of TMS at the dendritic level that could in principle be exploited for investigating these structures non-invasively.},

Here, we report the identification of a neural circuit for top-down control in the mouse somatosensory system. The circuit consisted of a long-range reciprocal projection between M2 secondary motor cortex and S1 primary somatosensory cortex. In vivo physiological recordings revealed that sensory stimulation induced sequential S1 to M2 followed by M2 to S1 neural activity. The top-down projection from M2 to S1 initiated dendritic spikes and persistent firing of S1 layer 5 (L5) neurons. Optogenetic inhibition of M2 input to S1 decreased L5 firing and the accurate perception of tactile surfaces. These findings demonstrate that recurrent input to sensory areas is essential for accurate perception and provide a physiological model for one type of top-down control circuit.},

We found that local NMDA spikes occurred in tuft dendrites of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons both spontaneously and following sensory input, and had a large influence on the number of output action potentials. Using two-photon activation of an intracellular caged NMDA receptor antagonist (tc-MK801), we found that isolated NMDA spikes typically occurred in multiple branches simultaneously and that sensory stimulation substantially increased their probability. Our results demonstrate that NMDA receptors have a vital role in coupling the tuft region of the layer 2/3 pyramidal neuron to the cell body, enhancing the effectiveness of layer 1 input.},

Paired temporally with an EPSP, this Ca²⁺ influx can result in synaptic plasticity. We studied the actions of neuropeptide Y (NPY), an abundant neocortical neuropeptide, on Ca²⁺ influx in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of somatosensory neocortex in Sprague Dawley and Wistar rats, using a combination of somatic and dendritic intracellular recordings and simultaneous Ca²⁺ imaging. Ca²⁺ influx induced by trains of bAPs above a neuron's CF was inhibited by NPY, acting only at the distal dendrite, via Y₁ receptors. NPY does not affect evoked synaptic glutamate release, paired synaptic facilitation, or synaptic rundown in longer trains. Extracellular Cs⁺ did not prevent NPY's postsynaptic effects, suggesting it does not act via either G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying K⁺ conductance (G(IRK)) or hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. NPY application suppresses the induction of the long-term depression (LTD) normally caused by pairing 100 EPSPs with bursts of 2 bAPs evoked at a supracritical frequency. These findings suggest that distal dendritic Ca²⁺ influx is necessary for LTD induction, and selective inhibition of this distal dendritic Ca²⁺ influx by NPY can thus regulate synaptic plasticity in layer 5 pyramidal neurons.},

Although they contain many nonlinear ion channels, their signal-transfer properties are linear under some experimental conditions. In experiments with continuous-time inputs, a resonant linear two-port model has been shown to provide a near-perfect fit to the dendrite-to-soma input-output relationship. In this study, we focused on this linear aspect of signal transfer using impedance functions that replace biophysical channel models in order to describe the electrical properties of the dendritic membrane. The membrane impedance model of dendrites preserves the accuracy of the two-port model with minimal computational complexity. Using this approach, we demonstrate two membrane impedance profiles of dendrites that reproduced the experimentally observed two-port results. These impedance profiles demonstrate that the two-port results are compatible with different computational schemes. In addition, our model highlights how dendritic resonance can minimize the location-dependent attenuation of signals at the resonant frequency. Thus, in this model, dendrites function as linear-resonant filters that carry signals between nonlinear computational units.},

  abstract     = {Processing of sensory information from both sides of the body requires coordination of sensory input between the two hemispheres. This coordination is achieved by transcallosal (interhemispheric) fibers that course though the upper cortical layers. In a recent study by Palmer et al. (2012), we investigated the role of this interhemispheric input on the dendritic and somatic activity of cortical pyramidal neurons. This study showed that interhemispheric input evokes GABAB-mediated inhibition in the distal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, decreasing the action potential output when paired with contralateral sensory stimulation. In contrast, layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons were not inhibited by interhemispheric input, possibly due to transcallosal fibers evoking more excitation in these neurons than layer 5 neurons. These results highlight both the precise nature of the microcircuitry of interhemispheric inhibition and how the balance between excitation and inhibition is different in the different layers of the cortex. Identifying the cellular and molecular elements involved in interhemipsheric inhibition is crucial not only for understanding higher brain function and but also dysfunction in the diseased brain.},

The mechanism is robustly triggered by coincident input to opposite poles of the neuron, is exquisitely matched to the large- and fine-scale architecture of the cortex, and is tightly controlled by local microcircuits of inhibitory neurons targeting subcellular compartments.

Using experimental models of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, it has been demonstrated that cortical pyramidal neurons and their projections are profoundly and permanently impaired. Yet, how the functional features of these cells are modified and how such modifications impact cognitive processes is still unknown. To address this, we studied the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of pyramidal neurons in young adult rats (P30-P60) exposed to ethanol inhalation during the first week of postnatal life (P2-P6). Dual whole-cell recordings from the soma and distal apical dendrites were performed and, following the injection of depolarizing current into the dendrites, layer 5 neurons from ethanol-treated (Et) animals displayed a lower number and a shorter duration of dendritic spikes, attributable to a downregulation of calcium electrogenesis. As a consequence, the mean number of action potentials recorded at the soma after dendritic current injection was also lower in Et animals. No significant differences between Et and controls were observed in the firing pattern elicited in layer 5 neurons by steps of depolarizing somatic current, even though the firing rate was significantly lower in Et animals. The firing pattern and the firing rate of layer 2/3 neurons were not affected by alcohol exposure.},

Pyramidal neurons, the most widespread excitatory neuron of the neocortex have multiple spike initiation zones, which interact via dendritic and somatic spikes actively propagating in all directions within the dendritic tree. For these neurons, therefore, both the location and timing of synaptic inputs are critical. The time window for which the backpropagating action potential can influence dendritic spike generation has been extensively studied in layer 5 neocortical pyramidal neurons of rat somatosensory cortex. Here, we re-examine this coincidence detection window for pyramidal cell types across the rat somatosensory cortex in layers 2/3, 5 and 6. We find that the time-window for optimal interaction is widest and shifted in layer 5 pyramidal neurons relative to cells in layers 6 and 2/3. Inputs arriving at the same time and locations will therefore differentially affect spike-timing dependent processes in the different classes of pyramidal neurons.},

Like layer 5 pyramidal neurons, they participate in a feedback loop with the thalamus and project to other cortical areas. Despite their unique location in the cortical microcircuit, synaptic integration in dendrites of L6 neurons has never been investigated. Given that all other neocortical pyramidal neurons perform active integration of synaptic inputs via local dendritic spike generation, we were interested to establish the apical dendritic properties of L6 pyramidal neurons. We measured active and passive properties of the apical dendrites of L6 pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory region of rat cortical slices using dual patch-clamp recordings from somata and dendrites and calcium imaging. We found that L6 pyramidal neurons share many fundamental dendritic properties with other neocortical pyramidal neurons, including the generation of local dendritic spikes under the control of dendritic inhibition, voltage-dependent support of backpropagating action potentials, timing-dependent dendritic integration, distally located I(h) channels, frequency-dependent Ca(2+) spike activation, and NMDA spike electrogenesis in the distal apical dendrite. The results suggest that L6 pyramidal neurons integrate synaptic inputs in layer 4 similar to the way other neocortical pyramidal neurons integrate input to layer 1. Thus, L6 pyramidal neurons can perform a similar associational task operating on inputs arriving at the granular and subgranular layers.},

Although high-frequency activity appears essential for plasticity, salience for memory formation is also provided by activity in ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine projections. Here, we report that activation of dopamine D1 receptors in dentate granule cells (DGCs) can preferentially increase dendritic excitability to both high-frequency afferent activity and high-frequency trains of backpropagating action potentials. Using whole-cell patch clamp recordings, calcium imaging, and neuropeptide Y to inhibit postsynaptic calcium influx, we found that activation of dendritic voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) is essential for dopamine-induced long-term potentiation (LTP), both in rat and human dentate gyrus (DG). Moreover, we demonstrate previously unreported spike-timing-dependent plasticity in the human hippocampus. These results suggest that when dopamine is released in the dentate gyrus with concurrent high-frequency activity there is an increased probability that synapses will be strengthened and reward-associated spatial memories will be formed.},

The tuft dendrites of layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons lie in layer 1, where long-range axons from secondary thalamic nuclei and higher cortical areas arrive. This class of input is very dependent on active thalamo-cortical loops and activity in higher brain areas and so is likely to be heavily influenced by the conscious state of the animal. If, as has been suggested, the dendrites of pyramidal neurons actively participate in this process, dendritic activity should greatly increase in the awake state. Here, we measured calcium activity in L5 pyramidal neuron dendrites using the "periscope" fiberoptic system. Recordings were made in the sensorimotor cortex of awake and anesthetized rats following sensory stimulation of the hindlimb. Bi-phasic dendritic responses evoked by hindlimb stimulation were extremely dependent on brain state. In the awake state, there was a prominent slow, delayed response whose integral was on average 14-fold larger than in the anesthetized state. Moreover, the dramatic increases in dendritic activity closely correlated to the strength of subsequent hindlimb movement. These changes were confined to L5 pyramidal dendrites and were not reflected in the response of layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons to air-puff stimuli in general (which actually decreased in the awake state). The results demonstrate that the activity of L5 pyramidal dendrites is a neural correlate of awake behavior.},

However, they have still not reached their full potential for in vivo imaging of neuronal activity due to limitations in expression levels, dynamic range, and sensitivity for reporting action potentials. Here, we report that viral expression of the ratiometric Ca(2+) sensor yellow cameleon 3.60 (YC3.60) in pyramidal neurons of mouse barrel cortex enables in vivo measurement of neuronal activity with high dynamic range and sensitivity across multiple spatial scales. By combining juxtacellular recordings and two-photon imaging in vitro and in vivo, we demonstrate that YC3.60 can resolve single action potential (AP)-evoked Ca(2+) transients and reliably reports bursts of APs with negligible saturation. Spontaneous and whisker-evoked Ca(2+) transients were detected in individual apical dendrites and somata as well as in local neuronal populations. Moreover, bulk measurements using wide-field imaging or fiber-optics revealed sensory-evoked YC3.60 signals in large areas of the barrel field. Fiber-optic recordings in particular enabled measurements in awake, freely moving mice and revealed complex Ca(2+) dynamics, possibly reflecting different behavior-related brain states. Viral expression of YC3.60 - in combination with various optical techniques - thus opens a multitude of opportunities for functional studies of the neural basis of animal behavior, from dendrites to the levels of local and large-scale neuronal populations.},

  abstract        = {Unlike the neocortex, sensory input to the piriform cortex is anatomically segregated in layer 1, making it ideal for studying the dendritic integration of synaptic inputs pivotal for sensory information processing. Here we investigated dendritic integration of olfactory bulb inputs in pyramidal cells using dual patch-clamp recordings along the soma-apical dendritic axis. We found that these dendrites are relatively compact with 50% maximal somatic current loss for synaptic inputs arriving at distal dendritic regions. Distal dendrites could generate small and fast local spikes, but they had little impact on the soma, indicating that they are only weakly active. In contrast to the neocortex, we found no evidence for dendritic Ca(2+) or NMDA spikes though these dendrites actively supported action potential backpropagation with concomitant entry of Ca(2+) ions. Based on experiments and simulations we suggest that regardless of dendritic location, olfactory bulb inputs have nearly uniform potency and are distributed diffusely over the distal apical tree (layer Ia), thereby minimizing sublinear summation effects. This indicates that any stimulus feature extraction performed by these cells will occur at the soma and is based on the nearly linear sum of olfactory bulb inputs, rather than on explicitly designed clusters of functionally related synapses in the dendritic tree.},

Both direct measurements and computer simulations showed that NMDA spikes are the dominant mechanism by which distal synaptic input leads to firing of the neuron and provide the substrate for complex parallel processing of top-down input arriving at the tuft. These data lead to a new unifying view of integration in pyramidal neurons in which all fine dendrites, basal and tuft, integrate inputs locally through the recruitment of NMDA receptor channels relative to the fixed apical calcium and axosomatic sodium integration points.},

This method gives high signal-to-noise dendritic fluorescence responses to sensory stimuli, and has been proven to be inexpensive, straightforward and reliable, allowing essentially unrestricted behavior. We describe refinements and practical optimizations of procedures aimed at achieving dendritic Ca(2+) imaging in freely moving animals.

It measures how much information is gained, on the average, about the output spike train of a postsynaptic neuron if the input spike train is known. It is a particularly appropriate measure for assessing the input-output relationship of neurons receiving dynamic stimuli. Here, we compare the SIE of simulated synaptic inputs measured experimentally in layer 5 cortical pyramidal neurons in vitro with the SIE computed from a minimal model constructed to fit the recorded data. We show that even with a simple model that is far from perfect in predicting the precise timing of the output spikes of the real neuron, the SIE can still be accurately predicted. This arises from the ability of the model to predict output spikes influenced by the input more accurately than those driven by the background current. This indicates that in this context, some spikes may be more important than others. Lastly we demonstrate another aspect where using mutual information could be beneficial in evaluating the quality of a model, by measuring the mutual information between the model's output and the neuron's output. The SIE, thus, could be a useful tool for assessing the quality of models of single neurons in preserving input-output relationship, a property that becomes crucial when we start connecting these reduced models to construct complex realistic neuronal networks.},

These are common building blocks of general adaptive behaviors. Here we consider the computational challenges required for escape behaviors to be implemented, discuss possible algorithmic solutions, and review some of the underlying neural circuits and mechanisms. We outline shared neural principles that can be implemented by evolutionarily ancient neural systems to generate escape behavior, to which cortical encephalization has been added to allow for increased sophistication and flexibility in responding to threat.

Recent experiments using modern systems neuroscience techniques have begun to elucidate the specific role of the periaqueductal gray in controlling escape. These have shown that periaqueductal gray neurons are crucial units for gating and commanding the initiation of escape, specifically activated in situations of imminent, escapable threat. In addition, it is becoming clear that the periaqueductal gray integrates brain-wide information that can modulate escape initiation to generate flexible defensive behaviors.},

  abstract        = {Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) plays a crucial role in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies, since it misfolds and accumulates in typical proteinaceous inclusions. While the function of aSyn is thought to be related to vesicle binding and trafficking, the precise molecular mechanisms linking aSyn with synucleinopathies are still obscure. aSyn can spread in a prion-like manner between interconnected neurons, contributing to the propagation of the pathology and to the progressive nature of synucleinopathies. Here, we investigated the interaction of aSyn with membranes and trafficking machinery pathways using cellular models of PD that are amenable to detailed molecular analyses. We found that different species of aSyn can enter cells and form high molecular weight species, and that membrane binding properties are important for the internalization of aSyn. Once internalized, aSyn accumulates in intracellular inclusions. Interestingly, we found that internalization is blocked in the presence of dynamin inhibitors (blocked membrane scission), suggesting the involvement of the endocytic pathway in the internalization of aSyn. By screening a pool of small Rab-GTPase proteins (Rabs) which regulate membrane trafficking, we found that internalized aSyn partially colocalized with Rab5A and Rab7. Initially, aSyn accumulated in Rab4A-labelled vesicles and, at later stages, it reached the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) where it gets degraded. In total, our study emphasizes the importance of membrane binding, not only as part of the normal function but also as an important step in the internalization and subsequent accumulation of aSyn. Importantly, we identified a fundamental role for Rab proteins in the modulation of aSyn processing, clearance and spreading, suggesting that targeting Rab proteins may hold important therapeutic value in PD and other synucleinopathies.},

We used the hLN to predict the somatic membrane potential of an in vivo-validated detailed biophysical model of a L2/3 pyramidal cell. Linear input integration with a single global dendritic nonlinearity achieved above 90% prediction accuracy. A novel hLN motif, input multiplexing into parallel processing channels, could improve predictions as much as conventionally used additional layers of local nonlinearities.

  abstract        = {Evolution has selected a repertoire of defensive behaviors that are essential for survival across all animal species. These behaviors are often stereotyped actions elicited in response to innately aversive sensory stimuli, but their success requires enough flexibility for adapting to different spatial environments, which can change rapidly. Here, we describe a behavioral assay to evaluate the influence of learned spatial knowledge on defensive behaviors in mice. We have adapted the widely used Barnes maze spatial memory assay to investigate how mice navigate to a shelter during escape responses to innately aversive sensory stimuli in a novel environment, and how they adapt to acute changes in the environment. This new assay is an ethological paradigm that does not require training and exploits the natural exploration patterns and navigation strategies in mice. We propose that the set of protocols described here are a powerful means of studying goal-directed behaviors and stimulus-triggered navigation, which should be of interest to both the fields of instinctive behaviors and spatial memory.},

  abstract        = {Escaping from imminent danger is an instinctive behaviour that is fundamental for survival, and requires the classification of sensory stimuli as harmless or threatening. The absence of threat enables animals to forage for essential resources, but as the level of threat and potential for harm increases, they have to decide whether or not to seek safety   . Despite previous work on instinctive defensive behaviours in rodents , little is known about how the brain computes the threat level for initiating  escape. Here we show that the probability and vigour of escape in mice scale with the saliency of innate threats, and are well described by a model that computes the distance between the threat level and an escape threshold. Calcium imaging and optogenetics in the midbrain of freely behaving mice show that the activity of excitatory neurons in the deep layers of the medial superior colliculus (mSC) represents the saliency of the threat stimulus and is predictive of escape, whereas glutamatergic neurons of the dorsal periaqueductal grey (dPAG) encode exclusively the choice to escape and control escape vigour. We demonstrate a feed-forward monosynaptic excitatory connection from mSC to dPAG neurons, which is weak and unreliable-yet required for escape behaviour-and provides a synaptic threshold for dPAG activation and the initiation of escape. This threshold can be overcome by high mSC network activity because of short-term synaptic facilitation and recurrent excitation within the mSC, which amplifies and sustains synaptic drive to the dPAG. Therefore, dPAG glutamatergic neurons compute escape decisions and escape vigour using a synaptic mechanism to  threshold threat information received from the mSC, and provide a biophysical model of how the brain performs a critical behavioural computation.},

Grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex are an attractive model system for addressing this question, as the computation they perform is clear: they convert synaptic inputs into spatially modulated, periodic firing. Whether active dendrites contribute to the generation of the dual temporal and rate codes characteristic of grid cell output is unknown. We show that dendrites of medial entorhinal cortex neurons are highly excitable and exhibit a supralinear input-output function in vitro, while in vivo recordings reveal membrane potential signatures consistent with recruitment of active dendritic conductances. By incorporating these nonlinear dynamics into grid cell models, we show that they can sharpen the precision of the temporal code and enhance the robustness of the rate code, thereby supporting a stable, accurate representation of space under varying environmental conditions. Our results suggest that active dendrites may therefore constitute a key cellular mechanism for ensuring reliable spatial navigation.},

  abstract        = {Instinctive defensive behaviors are essential for animal survival. Across the animal kingdom, there are sensory stimuli that innately represent threat and trigger stereotyped behaviors such as escape or freezing [1-4]. While innate behaviors are considered to be hard-wired stimulus-responses [5], they act within dynamic environments, and factors such as the properties of the threat [6-9] and its perceived intensity [1, 10, 11], access to food sources [12-14], and expectations from past experience [15, 16] have been shown to influence defensive behaviors, suggesting that their expression can be modulated. However, despite recent work [2, 4, 17-21], little is known about how flexible mouse innate defensive behaviors are and how quickly they can be modified by experience. To address this, we have investigated the dependence of escape behavior on learned knowledge about the spatial environment and how the behavior is updated when the environment changes acutely. Using behavioral assays with innately threatening visual and auditory stimuli, we show that the primary goal of escape in mice is to reach a previously memorized shelter location. Memory of the escape target can be formed in a single shelter visit lasting less than 20 s, and changes in the spatial environment lead to a rapid update of the defensive action, including changing the defensive strategy from escape to freezing. Our results show that although there are innate links between specific sensory features and defensive behavior, instinctive defensive actions are surprisingly flexible and can be rapidly updated by experience to adapt to changing spatial environments.},

Social defeat caused a weakening of functional connectivity between these two areas, and selective inhibition of these projections mimicked the behavioral effects of social defeat. These findings define a specific neural projection by which the prefrontal cortex can control and adapt social behavior.},

We found that multiple types of hypothalamic neurons, including those that oppositely regulate body weight, are specialized as near-perfect synaptic integrators that summate inputs over extended timescales. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) are greatly prolonged, outlasting the neuronal membrane time-constant up to 10-fold. This is due to the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 (Scn9a), previously associated with pain-sensation but not synaptic integration. Scn9a deletion in AGRP, POMC, or paraventricular hypothalamic neurons reduced EPSP duration, synaptic integration, and altered body weight in mice. In vivo whole-cell recordings in the hypothalamus confirmed near-perfect synaptic integration. These experiments show that integration of synaptic inputs over time by Nav1.7 is critical for body weight regulation and reveal a mechanism for synaptic control of circuits regulating long term homeostatic functions.},

Adult patients, with a solid tumour and literate with a minimum of four years schooling were included. For analysis and consistency we used the calculation of the Cronbach alpha coefficient and the Pearson linear correlation. The final questionnaire had some language and content adjustments compared to the original version in English. The correlation analysis of each item with the total score of the questionnaire showed coefficients above 0.99. The calculation of the Cronbach alpha coefficient was 0.9. The calculation of the Pearson linear correlation with the test and retest of the questionnaire was equal to 0.95.

For comparison, we also analyzed Proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons, an intermingled population that suppresses appetite and body weight. We find that AGRP neurons are considerably more sensitive to energy deficit than POMC neurons. Furthermore, we identify cell type-specific pathways involving endoplasmic reticulum-stress, circadian signaling, ion channels, neuropeptides, and receptors. Combined with methods to validate and manipulate these pathways, this resource greatly expands molecular insight into neuronal regulation of body weight, and may be useful for devising therapeutic strategies for obesity and eating disorders.},

We developed a theory that formalizes how a neuron's dendritic nonlinearity that is optimal for integrating synaptic inputs depends on the statistics of its presynaptic activity patterns. Based on their in vivo preynaptic population statistics (firing rates, membrane potential fluctuations, and correlations due to ensemble dynamics), our theory accurately predicted the responses of two different types of cortical pyramidal cells to patterned stimulation by two-photon glutamate uncaging. These results reveal a new computational principle underlying dendritic integration in cortical neurons by suggesting a functional link between cellular and systems--level properties of cortical circuits.},

  abstract        = {Classical feed-forward inhibition involves an excitation-inhibition sequence that enhances the temporal precision of neuronal responses by narrowing the window for synaptic integration. In the input layer of the cerebellum, feed-forward inhibition is thought to preserve the temporal fidelity of granule cell spikes during mossy fiber stimulation. Although this classical feed-forward inhibitory circuit has been demonstrated in vitro, the extent to which inhibition shapes granule cell sensory responses in vivo remains unresolved. Here we combined whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in vivo and dynamic clamp recordings in vitro to directly assess the impact of Golgi cell inhibition on sensory information transmission in the granule cell layer of the cerebellum. We show that the majority of granule cells in Crus II of the cerebrocerebellum receive sensory-evoked phasic and spillover inhibition prior to mossy fiber excitation. This preceding inhibition reduces granule cell excitability and sensory-evoked spike precision, but enhances sensory response reproducibility across the granule cell population. Our findings suggest that neighboring granule cells and Golgi cells can receive segregated and functionally distinct mossy fiber inputs, enabling Golgi cells to regulate the size and reproducibility of sensory responses.},

However, for thick or whole-mount tissue, each approach suffers from limitations, including limited spectral flexibility and lower signal or slow speed, poor penetration, and high background labeling, respectively. We have overcome these limitations by using transgenically expressed chemical tags for rapid, even, high-signal and low-background labeling of thick biological tissues. We first construct a platform of widely applicable transgenic Drosophila reporter lines, demonstrating that chemical labeling can accelerate staining of whole-mount fly brains by a factor of 100. Using viral vectors to deliver chemical tags into the mouse brain, we then demonstrate that this labeling strategy works well in mice. Thus this tag-based approach drastically improves the speed and specificity of labeling genetically marked cells in intact and/or thick biological samples.},

Here we characterize the organizational principles of functional vesicles at native hippocampal synapses with nanoscale resolution using fluorescent dye labeling and electron microscopy. We show that the recycling pool broadly scales with the magnitude of the total vesicle pool, but its average size is small (∼45 vesicles), highly variable, and regulated by CDK5/calcineurin activity. Spatial analysis demonstrates that recycling vesicles are preferentially arranged near the active zone and this segregation is abolished by actin stabilization, slowing the rate of activity-driven exocytosis. Our approach reveals a similarly biased recycling pool distribution at synapses in visual cortex activated by sensory stimulation in vivo. We suggest that in small native central synapses, efficient release of a limited pool of vesicles relies on their favored spatial positioning within the terminal.},

The relative proportions of these two pools are highly variable between individual synapses, prompting speculation on their specific relationship, and on the possible functions of the resting pool.Using fluorescence imaging of FM-styryl dyes and synaptophysinI-pHluorin(sypHy) as well as correlative electronmicroscopy approaches, we show here that Hebbian plasticity-dependent changes in synaptic strength in rat hippocampal neurons can increase the recycling pool fraction at the expense of the resting pool in individual synaptic terminals. This recruitment process depends on NMDA-receptor activation, nitric oxide signalling and calcineurin and is accompanied by an increase in the probability of neurotransmitter release at individual terminals. Blockade of actin-mediated intersynaptic vesicle exchange does not prevent recycling pool expansion demonstrating that vesicle recruitment is intrasynaptic.We propose that the conversion of resting pool vesicles to the functionally recycling pool provides a rapid mechanism to implement long-lasting changes in presynaptic efficacy.},

  abstract        = {Tonic inhibition is a key regulator of neuronal excitability and network function in the brain, but its role in sensory information processing remains poorly understood. The cerebellum is a favorable model system for addressing this question as granule cells, which form the input layer of the cerebellar cortex, permit high-resolution patch-clamp recordings in vivo, and are the only neurons in the cerebellar cortex that express the α6δ-containing GABA(A) receptors mediating tonic inhibition. We investigated how tonic inhibition regulates sensory information transmission in the rat cerebellum by using a combination of intracellular recordings from granule cells and molecular layer interneurons in vivo, selective pharmacology, and in vitro dynamic clamp experiments. We show that blocking tonic inhibition significantly increases the spontaneous firing rate of granule cells while only moderately increasing sensory-evoked spike output. In contrast, enhancing tonic inhibition reduces the spike probability in response to sensory stimulation with minimal effect on the spontaneous spike rate. Both manipulations result in a reduction in the signal-to-noise ratio of sensory transmission in granule cells and of parallel fiber synaptic input to downstream molecular layer interneurons. These results suggest that under basal conditions the level of tonic inhibition in vivo enhances the fidelity of sensory information transmission through the input layer of the cerebellar cortex.},

  abstract        = {Fast neuronal signalling relies on highly regulated vesicle fusion and recycling at specialized presynaptic terminals. Recently, examples of non-classical neurotransmission have also been reported, where fusion of vesicles can occur at sites remote from conventional synapses. This has potentially broad biological implications, but the underlying mechanisms are not well established. Here we show that a complete vesicle recycling pathway can occur at discrete axonal sites in mature hippocampal neurons and that extrasynaptic fusion is a robust feature of native tissue. We demonstrate that laterally mobile vesicle clusters trafficking between synaptic terminals become transiently stabilized by evoked action potentials and undergo complete but delayed Ca(2+)-dependent fusion along axons. This fusion is associated with dynamic actin accumulation and, subsequently, vesicles can be locally recycled, re-acidified and re-used. Immunofluorescence and ultrastructural work demonstrates that extrasynaptic fusion sites can have apposed postsynaptic specializations, suggesting that mobile vesicle recycling may underlie highly dynamic neuron-neuron communication.},

It is not known if different locations along single cortical dendrites integrate excitatory inputs in different ways. Here we have used two-photon glutamate uncaging and compartmental modeling to reveal a gradient of nonlinear synaptic integration in basal and apical oblique dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons. Excitatory inputs to the proximal dendrite sum linearly and require precise temporal coincidence for effective summation, whereas distal inputs are amplified with high gain and integrated over broader time windows. This allows distal inputs to overcome their electrotonic disadvantage, and become surprisingly more effective than proximal inputs at influencing action potential output. Thus, single dendritic branches can already exhibit nonuniform synaptic integration, with the computational strategy shifting from temporal coding to rate coding along the dendrite.},

In classical models of synaptic function these vesicle pools are synapse-specific, but accumulating evidence is now demonstrating that some vesicles are laterally mobile along axons and readily shared in a functional manner across adjacent terminals. In effect then, these mobile vesicles represent a further class of synapse-spanning vesicle pool, or "superpool". Here we outline the characteristics of this additional pool type, discussing its structural organization within axons and presynaptic terminals as well as its relationship with conventional vesicle pools. We draw comparisons between extrasynaptic vesicle dynamics and the growing literature on extrasynaptic mobility of non-vesicular synaptic elements which, taken together, raise important questions about the operational independence of adjacent release sites. We also examine the functional implications of lateral vesicle sharing, from the notion that extrasynaptic vesicles can contribute to the release capabilities of individual terminals, to its potential role as a substrate for facilitating changes in synaptic weight as a basis for plasticity.},

  abstract        = {Release probability (p(r)) is a fundamental presynaptic parameter which is critical in defining synaptic strength. Knowledge of how synapses set and regulate their p(r) is a fundamental step in understanding synaptic transmission and communication between neurons. Despite its importance, p(r) is difficult to measure directly at single synapses. One important strategy to achieve this has relied on the application of fluorescence-based imaging methods, but this is always limited by the lack of detailed information on the morphological and structural properties of the individual synapses under study, and thus precludes an investigation of the relationship between p(r) and synaptic anatomy. Here we outline a powerful methodology based on using FM-styryl dyes, photoconversion and correlative ultrastructural analysis in dissociated hippocampal cultured neurons, which provides both a direct readout of p(r) as well as nanoscale detail on synaptic organization and structure. We illustrate the value of this approach by investigating, at the level of individual reconstructed terminals, the relationship between release probability and defined vesicle pools. We show that in our population of synapses, p(r) is highly variable, and while it is positively correlated with the number of vesicles docked at the active zone it shows no relationship with the total number of synaptic vesicles. The lack of a direct correlation between total synaptic size and performance in these terminals suggests that factors other than the absolute magnitude of the synapse are the most important determinants of synaptic efficacy.},

  abstract        = {Synapse-specific vesicle pools have been widely characterized at central terminals. Here, we demonstrate a vesicle pool that is not confined to a synapse but spans multiple terminals. Using fluorescence imaging, correlative electron microscopy, and modeling of vesicle dynamics, we show that some recycling pool vesicles at synapses form part of a larger vesicle "superpool." The vesicles within this superpool are highly mobile and are rapidly exchanged between terminals (turnover: approximately 4% of total pool/min), significantly changing vesicular composition at synapses over time. In acute hippocampal slices we show that the mobile vesicle pool is also a feature of native brain tissue. We also demonstrate that superpool vesicles are available to synapses during stimulation, providing an extension of the classical recycling pool. Experiments using focal BDNF application suggest the involvement of a local TrkB-receptor-dependent mechanism for synapse-specific regulation of presynaptic vesicle pools through control of vesicle release and capture to or from the extrasynaptic pool.},

By applying patterned, two-photon glutamate uncaging, we found that single dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons exhibit sensitivity to the sequence of synaptic activation. This sensitivity is encoded by both local dendritic calcium signals and somatic depolarization, leading to sequence-selective spike output. The mechanism involves dendritic impedance gradients and nonlinear synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation and is generalizable to dendrites in different neuronal types. This enables discrimination of patterns delivered to a single dendrite, as well as patterns distributed randomly across the dendritic tree. Pyramidal cell dendrites can thus act as processing compartments for the detection of synaptic sequences, thereby implementing a fundamental cortical computation.},

Although p(r) is a fundamental parameter in defining synaptic efficacy, it is not uniform across all synapses, and the mechanisms by which a given synapse sets its basal release probability are unknown. By measuring p(r) at single presynaptic terminals in connected pairs of hippocampal neurons, we show that neighboring synapses on the same dendritic branch have very similar release probabilities, and p(r) is negatively correlated with the number of synapses on the branch. Increasing dendritic depolarization elicits a homeostatic decrease in p(r), and equalizing activity in the dendrite significantly reduces its variability. Our results indicate that local dendritic activity is the major determinant of basal release probability, and we suggest that this feedback regulation might be required to maintain synapses in their operational range.},

  abstract        = {During interphase, chromosomes are arranged into territories within a highly organized nuclear space containing several compartments. It is becoming clear that this complex nuclear arrangement is important for gene regulation and therefore expression. The study of chromosome organization in interphase requires high-resolution imaging methods that at the same time allow for flexible labelling strategies and preserve nuclear structure. Tokuyasu cryosections of cells or tissues provide a simple, high-resolution platform for performing immunolabelling and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on well-preserved samples. Here we show how FISH performed on thin cryosections (cryo-FISH) can be used for the study of chromosome organization at high resolution and in a quantitative manner. We have measured chromosome intermingling, volume and radial position, in resting and activated human lymphocytes, and observed chromosome-specific differences between the two cellular states. These differences are in part related to the nuclear expansion that occurs during activation, but are also likely to be tied to their different transcriptional profiles. Extrapolation of our dataset to the whole genome suggests that activated cells contain a lower amount of chromatin involved in intermingling than resting cells.},

It uses ground-state diffuse reflectance spectra obtained with and without filters, which prevents the luminescence of the dye from reaching the integrating sphere and the photodetector. New equations are presented here, correcting for the fluorescence emission of the dye, which depends on the detector sensitivity. Cut-on filters, which have a transmittance close to unity in the absorption region, and close to zero in the emission region, of the dye are used to obtain corrected reflectance spectra. The influence of the substrate was also taken into account. This methodology may be applied to other probes and surfaces or emissions of a different nature (i.e., phosphorescence or delayed fluorescence), and constitutes a very simple and general procedure to solve the important problem of luminescence quantum yield determination of probes adsorbed onto solid powdered surfaces.},

  abstract        = {The cortex represents information across widely varying timescales. For instance, sensory cortex encodes stimuli that fluctuate over few tens of milliseconds, whereas in association cortex behavioural choices can require the maintenance of information over seconds. However, it remains poorly understood whether diverse timescales result mostly from features intrinsic to individual neurons or from neuronal population activity. This question remains unanswered, because the timescales of coding in populations of neurons have not been studied extensively, and population codes have not been compared systematically across cortical regions. Here we show that population codes can be essential to achieve long coding timescales. Furthermore, we find that the properties of population codes differ between sensory and association cortices. We compared coding for sensory stimuli and behavioural choices in auditory cortex and posterior parietal cortex as mice performed a sound localization task. Auditory stimulus information was stronger in auditory cortex than in posterior parietal cortex, and both regions contained choice information. Although auditory cortex and posterior parietal cortex coded information by tiling in time neurons that were transiently informative for approximately 200 milliseconds, the areas had major differences in functional coupling between neurons, measured as activity correlations that could not be explained by task events. Coupling among posterior parietal cortex neurons was strong and extended over long time lags, whereas coupling among auditory cortex neurons was weak and short-lived. Stronger coupling in posterior parietal cortex led to a population code with long timescales and a representation of choice that remained consistent for approximately 1 second. In contrast, auditory cortex had a code with rapid fluctuations in stimulus and choice information over hundreds of milliseconds. Our results reveal that population codes differ across cortex and that coupling is a variable property of cortical populations that affects the timescale of information coding and the accuracy of behaviour.},

  abstract        = {Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous system. Its highly diverse biological activities are mediated via the G protein-coupled receptor that uniquely requires two accessory proteins for optimal function. CGRP receptor component protein (RCP) is a coupling protein necessary for CGRP-receptor signaling. In this study, we established the anatomical distribution of RCP in the rat central and peripheral nervous system and its relationship to CGRP immunoreactivity. RCP-immunoreactive (IR) perikarya are widely and selectively distributed in the cerebral cortex, septal nuclei, hippocampus, various hypothalamic nuclei, amygdala, nucleus colliculus, periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nuclei, locus coeruleus, cochlear nuclei, dorsal raphe nuclei, the solitary tractus nucleus and gracile nucleus, cerebellar cortex, various brainstem motor nuclei, the spinal dorsal and ventral horns. A sub-population of neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia were strongly RCP-IR. Overall, the localization of RCP-IR closely matched with that of CGRP-IR. We also determined whether RCP in DRG and dorsal horn neurons can be modulated by CGRP receptor blockade and pain-related pathological stimuli. The intrathecal injection of the antagonist CGRP(8-37) markedly increased RCP expression in the lumbar DRG and spinal dorsal horn. Carrageenan-induced plantar inflammation produced a dramatic bilateral increase in RCP expression in the dorsal horn while a partial sciatic nerve ligation reduced RCP expression in the ipsilateral superficial dorsal horn. Our data suggest that the distribution of RCP immunoreactivity is closely matched with CGRP immunoreactivity in most of central and peripheral nervous systems. The co-localization of RCP and CGRP in motoneurons and primary sensory neurons suggests that CGRP has an autocrine or paracrine effect on these neurons. Moreover, our data also suggest that RCP expression in DRG and spinal cord can be modulated during CGRP receptor blockade, inflammation or neuropathic pain and this CGRP receptor-associated protein is dynamically regulated.},

  abstract        = {The output of cortical columns is routed to different downstream targets via distinct pathways: cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical. It is as yet unclear what roles these pathways play in perception, and which cellular and circuit mechanisms regulate their gating. We recently showed that activation of the apical dendrites of layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons correlates with the threshold for perception, but these neurons come in two classes that target either other cortical or subcortical areas. In the present study, we took advantage of transgenic mouse lines for these L5 subclasses to determine their relative contributions to the perceptual process. We found that the activation of apical dendrites in neurons of the somatosensory cortex, which project to subcortical regions, almost exclusively determined the detection of tactile stimuli in mice. Our results suggest that dendritic activation drives context-dependent interactions between cortex and subcortical regions, including the higher-order thalamus, superior colliculus and striatum, which are crucial for perception.},

  abstract        = {We have determined the impact of rod death and cone reorganization on the spatiotemporal receptive fields (RFs) and spontaneous activity of distinct retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types. We compared RGC function between healthy and retinitis pigmentosa (RP) model rats (S334ter-3) at a time when nearly all rods were lost but cones remained. This allowed us to determine the impact of rod death on cone-mediated visual signaling, a relevant time point because the diagnosis of RP frequently occurs when patients are nightblind but daytime vision persists. Following rod death, functionally distinct RGC types persisted; this indicates that parallel processing of visual input remained largely intact. However, some properties of cone-mediated responses were altered ubiquitously across RGC types, such as prolonged temporal integration and reduced spatial RF area. Other properties changed in a cell type-specific manner, such as temporal RF shape (dynamics), spontaneous activity, and direction selectivity. These observations identify the extent of functional remodeling in the retina following rod death but before cone loss. They also indicate new potential challenges to restoring normal vision by replacing lost rod photoreceptors.  This study provides novel and therapeutically relevant insights to retinal function following rod death but before cone death. To determine changes in retinal output, we used a large-scale multielectrode array to simultaneously record from hundreds of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). These recordings of large-scale neural activity revealed that following the death of all rods, functionally distinct RGCs remain. However, the receptive field properties and spontaneous activity of these RGCs are altered in a cell type-specific manner.},

In a rat model of glaucoma in which intraocular pressure is raised by cautery of episcleral veins, the somata and dendritic arbors of surviving retinal ganglion cells expand. To assess physiological consequences of this change, we have measured visual receptive-field size in a primary retinal target, the superior colliculus. Using multiunit recording, receptive-field sizes were measured for glaucomatous eyes and compared to both those measured for contralateral control eyes and to homolateral eyes of unoperated animals. Episcleral vein occlusion increased intraocular pressure. This was accompanied by a significant increase in receptive-field size across the superior colliculus. The expansion of receptive fields was proportional to both degree and duration of the increase of intraocular pressure. We suggest that this increase in the size of receptive fields of glaucomatous eyes may be related to the increase in the size of dendritic arbors of the surviving ganglion cells in retina.},

Increases in the sizes of receptive fields on the periphery represented early stage of glaucomatous dysfunction. The relationship of duration and magnitude of IOP elevation had a significant correlation between percentages of receptive field sizes in the tectum. Large increases in receptive field sizes noted in the glaucomatous retinal terminal areas suggest the ability of the remaining retinal axons to compete and compensate for the loss of retinal axons.

  abstract        = {Inherited retinal degenerations encompass a wide range of diseases that result in the death of rod and cone photoreceptors, eventually leading to irreversible blindness. Low vision survives at early stages of degeneration, at which point it could rely on residual populations of rod/cone photoreceptors as well as the inner retinal photoreceptor, melanopsin. To date, the impact of partial retinal degeneration on visual responses in the primary visual thalamus (dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, dLGN) remains unknown, as does their relative reliance on surviving rod and cone photoreceptors vs. melanopsin. To answer these questions, we recorded visually evoked responses in the dLGN of anesthetized   mice using in vivo electrophysiology at an age (3-5 wk) at which cones are partially degenerate and rods are absent. We found that excitatory (ON) responses to light had lower amplitude and longer latency in   mice compared with age-matched visually intact controls; however, contrast sensitivity and spatial receptive field size were largely unaffected at this early stage of degeneration. Responses were retained when those wavelengths to which melanopsin is most sensitive were depleted, indicating that they were driven primarily by surviving cones. Inhibitory responses appeared absent in the   thalamus, as did light-evoked gamma oscillations in firing. This description of fundamental features of the dLGN visual response at this intermediate stage of retinal degeneration provides a context for emerging attempts to restore vision by introducing ectopic photoreception to the degenerate retina.  This study provides new therapeutically relevant insights to visual responses in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus during progressive retinal degeneration. Using in vivo electrophysiology, we demonstrate that visual responses have lower amplitude and longer latency during degeneration, but contrast sensitivity and spatial receptive fields remain unaffected. Such visual responses are driven predominantly by surviving cones rather than melanopsin photoreceptors. The functional integrity of this visual pathway is encouraging for emerging attempts at visual restoration.},

  abstract        = {Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and is characterized by progressive retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death. An experimental model of glaucoma has been established by elevating the intraocular pressure (IOP) via microbead occlusion of ocular fluid outflow in mice. Studies in this model have found visual dysfunction that varied with adaptational state, occurred before anatomical changes, and affected OFF RGCs more than ON RGCs. These results indicate subtle alterations in the underlying retinal circuitry that could help identify disease before irreversible RGC changes. Therefore, we looked at how RGC function was altered with elevated IOP under both photopic and scotopic conditions. We first found that responses to light offset are diminished with IOP elevation along with a concomitant decrease in receptive field center size for OFF RGCs. In addition, the antagonistic surround strength and size was reduced in ON RGCs. Furthermore, elevation of IOP significantly accelerated the photopic temporal tuning of RGC center responses in both ON and OFF RGCs. We found that some of the IOP-induced functional changes to OFF RGCs relied on ON cross-over pathways, indicating dysfunction in inner retinal circuitry. Overall, these results suggest that IOP alters multiple functions in the retina depending on the adaptational state. They provide a basis for designing multiple functional tests for early detection of glaucoma and for circuit-specific therapeutic targets in treatment of this blinding disease.},

  abstract        = {Visual crowding is the inability to identify visible features when they are surrounded by other structure in the peripheral field. Since natural environments are replete with structure and most of our visual field is peripheral, crowding represents the primary limit on vision in the real world. However, little is known about the characteristics of crowding under natural conditions. Here we examine where crowding occurs in natural images. Observers were required to identify which of four locations contained a patch of "dead leaves'' (synthetic, naturalistic contour structure) embedded into natural images. Threshold size for the dead leaves patch scaled with eccentricity in a manner consistent with crowding. Reverse correlation at multiple scales was used to determine local image statistics that correlated with task performance. Stepwise model selection revealed that local RMS contrast and edge density at the site of the dead leaves patch were of primary importance in predicting the occurrence of crowding once patch size and eccentricity had been considered. The absolute magnitudes of the regression weights for RMS contrast at different spatial scales varied in a manner consistent with receptive field sizes measured in striate cortex of primate brains. Our results are consistent with crowding models that are based on spatial averaging of features in the early stages of the visual system, and allow the prediction of where crowding is likely to occur in natural images.},

A recently published model of retinal ganglion cell (GC) receptive field density is used to obtain best estimates of the receptive fields per solid degree at each stimulus point in the 24-2 test pattern array. A method of age related change compensation is proposed and a functional relationship between perimetric sensitivity and GC survival is used for loss quantification. Data for the 24-2 test pattern array for the right eye are presented. These can be adjusted for age related loss, but are also expressed as percentages which are considered to be age invariant. Simple models relating receptive field density to sensitivity are proposed for quantification. Equations relating GC receptive field densities at points in the visual field to normative data on sensitivity are proposed to estimate GC loss in glaucoma. If 1/Lambert sensitivity is <800, (29 dB), a linear relationship applies and a loss factor of 1-10, where TD is the signed total deviation in decibels, may be applied to values in a percentage chart which are provided to give the percentage loss for each stimulus. Higher sensitivities are non-linearly related. Two equations are proposed to cover the range corresponding to thresholds from 0 dB to 33 dB. Hypothetical examples are given and the relationship between visual field defects and pattern electroretinograms is discussed in quantitative terms.},

Using a microbead injection technique to chronically raise IOP for 15 or 30 d in mice, we identified the early changes in visual response properties of different types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and correlated these changes with neuronal morphology before cell death. Microbead-injected eyes showed reduced optokinetic tracking as well as cell death. In such eyes, multielectrode array recordings revealed that four RGC types show diverse alterations in their light responses upon IOP elevation. OFF-transient RGCs exhibited a more rapid decline in both structural and functional organizations compared with other RGCs. In contrast, although the light-evoked responses of OFF-sustained RGCs were perturbed, the dendritic arbor of this cell type remained intact. ON-transient and ON-sustained RGCs had normal functional receptive field sizes but their spontaneous and light-evoked firing rates were reduced. ON- and OFF-sustained RGCs lost excitatory synapses across an otherwise structurally normal dendritic arbor. Together, our observations indicate that there are changes in spontaneous activity and light-evoked responses in RGCs before detectable dendritic loss. However, when dendrites retract, we found corresponding changes in receptive field center size. Importantly, the effects of IOP elevation are not uniformly manifested in the structure and function of diverse RGC populations, nor are distinct RGC types perturbed within the same time-frame by such a challenge.},

In anesthetized, immobilized cats, individual axonal responses to movement of forelimb G hairs were recorded in the ipsilateral cuneate fasciculus at C1-C2 with a glass-insulated tungsten microelectrode. Several test criteria were used to identify primary afferent axons among the recorded neurons. 2. The output discharge in the parent sensory axon during continuous air-jet stimulation of the entire receptive field was irregular and was usually maintained. Criteria for statistical stability were introduced, permitting an analysis of the response as a stable point process. 3. The main interspike interval during the response to maximal air-jet stimulation ranged in different units from 4 to 100 ms, with a transition zone near 20 ms (50/s) between short and long mean interval units. Long and short mean interval units tended to be related to G2- and G1-type hair receptors, respectively. 4. In both short and long mean interval units, the interspike-interval distribution (IID) had a dead time (usually 2-4 ms), a sigmoidal rising limb, a single mode, and a monotonic falling limb, a single mode, and a monotonic falling limb. In short mean interval units, the decrement of the falling limb was described by a single exponential. 5. The value of the standard deviation of the IID was a little less than that of the mean interval minus dead time, the inequality probably resulting from the finite duration of the rising limb and, in long mean interval units, the nonexponential falling limb. 6. Joint interval analysis revealed that successive intervals were independent except in short mean interval units, where the shortest intervals tended to be followed by intervals shorter than the mean. 7. The expectation density function did not reveal any periods in the output discharge. In short mean interval units, a constant mean (planteau) level was attained after a finite rise time and usually one or more overshooting-undershooting sequences. In long mean interval units, the expectation density function monotonically rose to the plateau level. 8. Reducing the air-jet intensity caused an increase in mean interval of discharge and in standard deviation of the IID and slowed the rise time of the expectation density function to the plateau level. 9. Similarities and differences between the whole-field response to air-jet stimulation and the Poisson process are discussed.},

  abstract        = {Lesions of striate cortex (V1) trigger massive retrograde degeneration of neurons in the LGN. In primates, these lesions also lead to scotomas, within which conscious vision is abolished. Mediation of residual visual capacity within these regions (blindsight) has been traditionally attributed to an indirect visual pathway to the extrastriate cortex, which involves the superior colliculus and pulvinar complex. However, recent studies have suggested that preservation of the LGN is critical for behavioral evidence of blindsight, raising the question of what type of visual information is channeled by remaining neurons in this structure. A possible contribution of LGN neurons to blindsight is predicated on two conditions: that the neurons that survive degeneration remain visually responsive, and that their receptive fields continue to represent the region of the visual field inside the scotoma. We tested these conditions in male and female marmoset monkeys ( ) with partial V1 lesions at three developmental stages (early postnatal life, young adulthood, old age), followed by long recovery periods. In all cases, recordings from the degenerated LGN revealed neurons with well-formed receptive fields throughout the scotoma. The responses were consistent and robust, and followed the expected eye dominance and retinotopy observed in the normal LGN. The responses had short latencies and preceded those of neurons recorded in the extrastriate middle temporal area. These findings suggest that the pathway that links LGN neurons to the extrastriate cortex is physiologically viable and can support residual vision in animals with V1 lesions incurred at various ages.  Patients with a lesion of the primary visual cortex (V1) can retain certain visually mediated behaviors, particularly if the lesion occurs early in life. This phenomenon ("blindsight") not only sheds light on the nature of consciousness, but also has implications for studies of brain circuitry, development, and plasticity. However, the pathways that mediate blindsight have been the subject of debate. Recent studies suggest that projections from the LGN might be critical, but this finding is puzzling given that the lesions causes severe cell death in the LGN. Here we demonstrate in monkeys that the surviving LGN neurons retain a remarkable level of visual function and could therefore be the source of the visual information that supports blindsight.},

We used a bead injection technique to increase IOP in mice of both genders by an average of ∼3 mmHg for 2 weeks. This level of IOP elevation was lower than that achieved in other studies, which allowed for the study of subtle IOP effects. We used multielectrode array recordings to determine the cellular responses of RGCs exposed to this mild degree of IOP elevation. We found that RGC photopic receptive field (RF) center size and whole-field RGC firing rates were unaffected by IOP elevation. In contrast, we found that the temporal properties of RGC photopic responses in the RF center were accelerated, particularly in ON sustained cells. We also detected a loss of antagonistic surround in several RGC subtypes. Finally, spontaneous firing rate, interspike interval variance, and contrast sensitivity were altered according to the magnitude of IOP exposure and also displayed an IOP-dependent effect. Together, these results suggest that individual RGC physiologic parameters have unique IOP-related functional thresholds that exist concurrently and change following IOP elevation according to specific patterns. Furthermore, even subtle IOP elevation can impart profound changes in RGC function, which in some cases may occur in an IOP-dependent manner. This system of overlapping functional thresholds likely underlies the complex effects of elevated IOP on the retina.  Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the obligate output neurons of the retina and are injured by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in diseases such as glaucoma. In this study, a subtle elevation of IOP in mice for 2 weeks revealed distinct IOP-related functional thresholds for specific RGC physiologic parameters and sometimes showed an IOP-dependent effect. These data suggest that overlapping IOP-related thresholds and response profiles exist simultaneously in RGCs and throughout the retina. These overlapping thresholds likely explain the range of RGC responses that occur following IOP elevation and highlight the wide capacity of neurons to respond in a diseased state.},

  abstract        = {In many cases of inherited retinal degenerations, ganglion cells are spared despite photoreceptor cell death, making it possible to stimulate them to restore visual function. Several studies have shown that it is possible to express an optogenetic protein in ganglion cells and make them light sensitive, a promising strategy to restore vision. However the spatial resolution of optogenetically-reactivated retinas has rarely been measured, especially in the primate. Since the optogenetic protein is also expressed in axons, it is unclear if these neurons will only be sensitive to the stimulation of a small region covering their somas and dendrites, or if they will also respond to any stimulation overlapping with their axon, dramatically impairing spatial resolution. Here we recorded responses of mouse and macaque retinas to random checkerboard patterns following an in vivo optogenetic therapy. We show that optogenetically activated ganglion cells are each sensitive to a small region of visual space. A simple model based on this small receptive field predicted accurately their responses to complex stimuli. From this model, we simulated how the entire population of light sensitive ganglion cells would respond to letters of different sizes. We then estimated the maximal acuity expected by a patient, assuming it could make an optimal use of the information delivered by this reactivated retina. The obtained acuity is above the limit of legal blindness. Our model also makes interesting predictions on how acuity might vary upon changing the therapeutic strategy, assuming an optimal use of the information present in the retinal activity. Optogenetic therapy could thus potentially lead to high resolution vision, under conditions that our model helps to determinine.},

  abstract        = {Acute ischemic stroke is one of the most causes of death all over the world. Onset to treatment time is critical in stroke diagnosis and treatment. Considering the time consumption and high price of MR imaging, CT perfusion (CTP) imaging is strongly recommended for acute stroke. However, too much CT radiation during CTP imaging may increase the risk of health problems. How to reduce CT radiation dose in CT perfusion imaging has drawn our great attention. In this study, the original 30-pass CTP images are downsampled to 15 passes in time sequence, which equals to 50% radiation dose reduction. Then, a residual deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model is proposed to restore the downsampled 15-pass CTP images to 30 passes to calculate the parameters such as cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, mean transit time, time to peak for stroke diagnosis and treatment. The deep restoration CNN is implemented simply and effectively with 16 successive convolutional layers which form a wide enough receptive field for input image data. 18 patients' CTP images are employed as training set and the other six patients' CTP images are treated as test dataset in this study. Experiments demonstrate that our CNN can restore high-quality CTP images in terms of structural similarity index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The average SSIM and PSNR for test images are 0.981 and 56.25, and the SSIM and PSNR of regions of interest are 0.915 and 42.44, respectively, showing promising quantitative level. In addition, we compare the perfusion maps calculated from the restored images and from the original images, and the average perfusion results of them are extremely close. Areas of hypoperfusion of six test cases could be detected with comparable accuracy by radiologists. The trained model can restore the temporally downsampled 15-pass CTP to 30 passes very well. According to the contrast test, sufficient information cannot be restored with, e.g., simple interpolation method and deep convolutional generative adversarial network, but can be restored with the proposed CNN model. This method can be an optional way to reduce radiation dose during CTP imaging.},

  abstract        = {Key issues concerning ganglion cell type-specific loss and synaptic changes in animal models of experimental glaucoma remain highly debated. Importantly, changes in the structure and function of various RGC types that occur early, within 14 d after acute, transient intraocular pressure elevation, have not been previously assessed. Using biolistic transfection of individual RGCs and multielectrode array recordings to measure light responses in mice, we examined the effects of laser-induced ocular hypertension on the structure and function of a subset of RGCs. Among the α-like RGCs studied, αOFF-transient RGCs exhibited higher rates of cell death, with corresponding reductions in dendritic area, dendritic complexity, and synapse density. Functionally, OFF-transient RGCs displayed decreases in spontaneous activity and receptive field size. In contrast, neither αOFF-sustained nor αON-sustained RGCs displayed decreases in light responses, although they did exhibit a decrease in excitatory postsynaptic sites, suggesting that synapse loss may be one of the earliest signs of degeneration. Interestingly, presynaptic ribbon density decreased to a greater degree in the OFF sublamina of the inner plexiform layer, corroborating the hypothesis that RGCs with dendrites stratifying in the OFF sublamina may be damaged early. Indeed, OFF arbors of ON-OFF RGCs lose complexity more rapidly than ON arbors. Our results reveal type-specific differences in RGC responses to injury with a selective vulnerability of αOFF-transient RGCs, and furthermore, an increased susceptibility of synapses in the OFF sublamina. The selective vulnerability of specific RGC types offers new avenues for the design of more sensitive functional tests and targeted neuroprotection. Conflicting reports regarding the selective vulnerability of specific retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types in glaucoma exist. We examine, for the first time, the effects of transient intraocular pressure elevation on the structure and function of various RGC types. Among the α-like RGCs studied, αOFF-transient RGCs are the most vulnerable to transient transient intraocular pressure elevation as measured by rates of cell death, morphologic alterations in dendrites and synapses, and physiological dysfunction. Specifically, we found that presynaptic ribbon density decreased to a greater degree in the OFF sublamina of the inner plexiform layer. Our results suggest selective vulnerability both of specific types of RGCs and of specific inner plexiform layer sublaminae, opening new avenues for identifying novel diagnostic and treatment targets in glaucoma.},

  abstract        = {Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is expressed in mammalian retina but the location and potential modulatory effects of NPY receptor activation remain largely unknown. Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death is a hallmark of several retinal degenerative diseases, particularly glaucoma. Using purified RGCs and ex vivo rat retinal preparations, we have measured RGC intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and RGC spiking activity, respectively. We found that NPY attenuated the increase in the [Ca2+]i triggered by glutamate mainly via Y1 receptor activation. Moreover, (Leu31, Pro34)-NPY, a Y1/Y5 receptor agonist, increased the initial burst response of OFF-type RGCs, although no effect was observed on RGC spontaneous spiking activity. The Y1 receptor activation was also able to directly modulate RGC responses by attenuating the NMDA-induced increase in RGC spiking activity. These results suggest that Y1 receptor activation, at the level of inner or outer plexiform layers, leads to modulation of RGC receptive field properties. Using in vitro cultures of rat retinal explants exposed to NMDA, we found that NPY pretreatment prevented NMDA-induced cell death. However, in an animal model of retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury, pretreatment with NPY or (Leu31, Pro34)-NPY was not able to prevent apoptosis or rescue RGCs. In conclusion, we found modulatory effects of NPY application that for the first time were detected at the level of RGCs. However, further studies are needed to evaluate whether NPY neuroprotective actions detected in retinal explants can be translated into animal models of retinal degenerative diseases.},

Stimulation of the inner-retinal neurons by neuroprosthetic implants is one of the clinically approved vision-restoration strategies, providing basic visual percepts to blind patients. However, little is understood as to what degree the degenerating retinal circuitry and the resulting aberrant hyperactivity may prevent the stimulation of physiological electrical activity. Therefore, we electrically stimulated ex vivo retinas from wild-type (wt; C57BL/6J) and blind (rd10 and rd1) mice using an implantable subretinal microchip and simultaneously recorded and analyzed the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) output with a flexible microelectrode array. We found that subretinal anodal stimulation of the rd10 retina and wt retina evoked similar spatiotemporal RGC-spiking patterns. In both retinas, electrically stimulated ON and a small percentage of OFF RGC responses were detected. The spatial selectivity of the retinal network to electrical stimuli reveals an intact underlying network with a median receptive-field center of 350 μm in both retinas. An antagonistic surround is activated by stimulation with large electrode fields. However, in rd10 and to a higher percentage, in rd1 retinas, rhythmic and spatially unconfined RGC patterns were evoked by anodal or by cathodal electrical stimuli. Our findings demonstrate that the surviving retinal circuitry in photoreceptor-degenerated retinas is preserved in a way allowing for the stimulation of temporally diverse and spatially confined RGC activity. Future vision restoration strategies can build on these results but need to avoid evoking the easily inducible rhythmic activity in some retinal circuits.},

Forty-one Patients receiving specialized inpatient palliative care prospectively performed a music therapy intervention consisting of at least two sessions (total number of sessions: 166; per patient average: 4, range, 2-10). Applied music therapy methods and content were not pre-determined. Therapeutic subjects and psychosocial needs addressed in music therapy sessions were identified from prospective semi-structured "field notes" using qualitative content analysis. Patient- and treatment-related characteristics as well as factors related to music and music therapy were assessed by questionnaire or retrieved from medical records. Seven main categories of subjects were identified: "condition, treatment, further care", "coping with palliative situation", "emotions and feelings", "music and music therapy", "biography", "social environment", and "death, dying, and spiritual topics". Patients addressed an average of 4.7 different subjects (range, 1-7). Some subjects were associated with gender (p = .022) and prior impact of music in patients' life (p = .012). The number of subjects per session was lower when receptive music therapy methods were used (p = .040). Psychosocial needs were categorized into nine main dimensions: "relaxing and finding comfort", "communication and dialogue", "coping and activation of internal resources", "activity and vitality", "finding expression", "sense of self and reflection", "finding emotional response", "defocusing and diversion", and "structure and hold". Patients expressed an average of 4.9 psychosocial needs (range, 1-8). Needs were associated with age, parallel art therapy (p = .010), role of music in patient's life (p = .021), and the applied music therapy method (p = .012). Seven main categories of therapeutically relevant subjects and nine dimensions of psychosocial needs could be identified when music therapy was delivered to terminally ill cancer patients. Results showed that patients with complex psychosocial situations addressed an average number of five subjects and needs, respectively. Some socio-demographic factors, the role of music in patient's lives and the applied music therapy methods may be related with the kind and number of expressed subjects and needs.},

  abstract        = {The whisker-sensory trigeminal central pathway of rodents is an established model for studies of activity-dependent neural plasticity. The first relay station of the pathway is the trigeminal principal nucleus (PrV), the ventral part of which receives sensory inputs mainly from the infraorbital branch of the maxillary trigeminal nerve (ION). Whisker-sensory afferents play an important role in the development of the morphological and physiological properties of PrV neurons. In neonates, deafferentation by ION transection leads to the disruption of whisker-related neural patterns (barrelettes) and cell death within a specific time window (critical period), as revealed by morphological studies. Whisker-sensory inputs control synaptic elimination, postsynaptic AMPA receptor trafficking, astrocyte-mediated synaptogenesis, and receptive-field characteristics of PrV cells, without a postnatal critical period. Sensory activity-dependent synaptic plasticity requires the activation of NMDA receptors and involves the participation of glia. However, the basic physiological properties of PrV neurons, such as cell type-specific ion channels, presynaptic terminal function, postsynaptic NMDA receptor subunit composition, and formation of the inhibitory circuitry, are independent of sensory inputs. Therefore, the first relay station of the whisker sensation is largely mature-like and functional at birth. Delineation of activity-dependent and activity-independent features of the postnatal PrV is important for understanding the development and functional characteristics of downstream trigeminal stations in the thalamus and neocortex. This mini review focuses on such features of the developing rodent PrV.},

  abstract        = {Glaucoma is characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death and frequently associated with elevated IOP. How RGCs degenerate before death is little understood, so we sought to investigate RGC degeneration in a mouse model of ocular hypertension. A laser-induced mouse model of chronic ocular hypertension mimicked human high-tension glaucoma. Immunohistochemistry was used to characterize overall RGC loss and an optomotor behavioral test to measure corresponding changes in visual capacity. Changes in RGC functional properties were characterized by a large-scale multielectrode array (MEA). The transgenic Thy-1-YFP mouse line, in which a small number of RGCs are labeled with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), permitted investigation of whether subtypes of RGCs or RGCs from particular retinal areas were differentially vulnerable to elevated IOP. Sustained IOP elevation in mice was achieved by laser photocoagulation. We confirmed RGC loss and decreased visual acuity in ocular hypertensive mice. Furthermore, these mice had fewer visually responsive cells with smaller receptive field sizes compared to controls. We demonstrated that RGC dendritic shrinkage started from the vertical axis of hypertensive eyes and that mono-laminated ON cells were more susceptible to IOP elevation than bi-laminated ON-OFF cells. Moreover, a subgroup of ON RGCs labeled by the SMI-32 antibody exhibited significant dendritic atrophy in the superior quadrant of the hypertensive eyes. RGC degeneration depends on subtype and location in hypertensive eyes. This study introduces a valuable model to investigate how the structural and functional degeneration of RGCs leads to visual impairments.},

During the Weimar Republic he advocated improving the institutional system based on principles of psychiatric reform, but was already receptive to concepts of racial hygiene. Shortly after the National Socialists seized power, Nitsche was already an influential proponent and participant in eugenic measures in Saxony and actively involved in implementing the "Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring." He increasingly appraised the value of a patient according to the person's economic performance. It was also Nitsche's opinion that the consequence of this extreme rationalization of human life was to exterminate "life unworthy of life." As a T4 appointed head assessor he decided in the last instance whether thousands of people would live or die. As the Medical Director of the T4 program, he was later directly responsible for continuing the massacre as "decentralized euthanasia." At the euthanasia trial in Dresden he was condemned to death and executed in 1948.},

  abstract        = {Alterations in retinal ganglion cell response patterns were profiled in dystrophic Royal College of Surgeons (hereafter RCS) rats over the first 100 postnatal days as a baseline for retinal rescue and vision restoration strategies. This method enabled the evaluation of the extent to which postreceptoral neuronal attributes in degenerating retinas mirror inferred declines in photoreceptor function. Single-unit responses from large retinal ganglion cells were recorded from age-matched dystrophic RCS (RCS-rdy(-)) and congenic RCS-p(+) (hereafter wild-type or wt) rats were recorded in vitro under visual control. Cells were profiled with conventional spatial and flux stimulus modulations. Ganglion cell single unit and population attributes alter slowly over the course of photoreceptor degeneration in dystrophic RCS rats, with significant decreases in apparent receptive field size, contrast sensitivity, and threshold sensitivity detected by the first month of life. Spatial frequency tuning and contrast responses were extremely weak by postnatal day (P)76, paralleled by a progressive decline in signal-to-noise (S-N) ratio to roughly unity by postnatal day (P)107. This decline was only a simple loss of responsivity, as background firing rates increased substantially over time. Whereas wt retinas were dominated by ON-center cells (15/23 cells), dystrophic animals were dominated by OFF-center cells by P47 (24/27 cells). The first definitive signs of degeneration in dystrophic RCS rats are parallel decreases in ganglion cell threshold sensitivity and receptive field size, followed by deterioration in spatial summation. Arguably, these changes can be qualitatively explained as photoreceptor signaling losses. However, the apparent shift in population profile from ON- to OFF-center ganglion cells long before loss of the b-wave at P90 implies that a reactive mechanism such as bipolar cell rewiring and/or transformation of neuronal phenotypes occur during the early phase of photoreceptor stress, before rod and cone death.},

Here we report electrophysiological properties of Y- (morphological alpha) and X- (morphological beta) cells at 5 and 14 days after axotomy in comparison with those of intact Y- and X-cells. Most of the axotomized RGCs revealed characteristic visual response properties that enable us to classify them into Y- or X-cells. Physiological sampling ratio of X-cells sharply decreased from day 5 to 14 after axotomy, corresponding to the previous morphological results. As compared with intact RGCs, axotomized RGCs of both Y- and X-type revealed the following abnormalities: smaller receptive field centers, weaker visual responses and lower spontaneous activities. Intracellular injections of Lucifer yellow into axotomized and intact RGCs at eccentricities 0-6 mm from the area centralis revealed no sign of shrinkage in dendritic field size of either alpha or beta cells on day 5 and day 14 after axotomy, revealing that observed smaller receptive field centers of axotomized RGCs on day 5 were not due to the change of dendritic field sizes. These results suggest that the major events occurring shortly after axotomy are significant loss of synaptic inputs from afferent neurons in the retina and/or changes of membrane properties of axotomized RGCs. These events can also explain lower spontaneous activities and weaker visual responses of axotomized RGCs.},

  abstract        = {In the frog Hyla moorei we have estimated there to be between approximately 450,000 and 750,000 cells in the retinal ganglion cell layer. Optic axon counts and retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) indicated that 72-76% of these were ganglion cells. Cells of this type were distributed as a temporally situated area centralis within a horizontal visual streak. Cell and optic axon counts showed that there was an approximately 40% loss of ganglion cells during optic nerve regeneration. Ganglion cells appeared chromatolysed by 6-8 days after an extracranial nerve crush but there was no indication of cell death until 15 days. By this stage anterograde transport of HRP indicated that axons had reached the chiasma. Death was first seen in the area centralis, extended along the streak, and finally was observed in the periphery by 65 days; cell counts demonstrated that at this time the wave of death was almost complete. We have previously shown by electrophysiological visual mapping (Humphrey and Beazley, '82) and confirmed in this study that visuotectal projections were retinotopically organized during regeneration. Multiunit receptive fields were initially large but progressively refined starting in nasal field (temporal retina) to restore a normal projection. The similar sequences whereby the visuotectal projection became refined and death took place in the retinal ganglion cell layer suggested that death may be related to a process of organization within the regenerating projection. In normal animals primary visual pathways revealed by anterograde transport of HRP were essentially similar to those of Rana pipiens and R. esculenta. Regenerating axons generally remained within optic pathways. Exceptions were a retinoretinal projection which was not completely withdrawn even after 1,028 days and a direct projection to the ipsilateral tectum via an inappropriate part of the optic tract.},

Health professionals should not rely solely on illness severity to initiate ACP. Rather, patients from different illness categories should be approached, but with sensitivity to their emotional cues. Participants who were receptive to end-of-life issues enjoyed the DVD.

  abstract        = {Not all neuropathic pain patients gain relief from current therapies that include the anticonvulsant, gabapentin, thought to modulate calcium channel function. We report a neural circuit that is permissive for the effectiveness of gabapentin. Substance P-saporin (SP-SAP) was used to selectively ablate superficial dorsal horn neurons expressing the neurokinin-1 receptor for substance P. These neurons project to the brain as shown by retrograde labelling and engage descending brainstem serotonergic influences that enhance spinal excitability via a facilitatory action on 5HT(3) receptors. We show the integrity of this pathway following nerve injury contributes to the behavioural allodynia, neuronal plasticity of deep dorsal horn neurons and the injury-specific actions of gabapentin. Thus SP-SAP attenuated the tactile and cold hypersensitivity and abnormal neuronal coding (including spontaneous activity, expansion of receptive field size) seen after spinal nerve ligation. Furthermore the powerful actions of gabapentin after neuropathy were blocked by either ablation of NK-1 expressing neurones or 5HT(3) receptor antagonism using ondansetron. Remarkably, 5HT(3) receptor activation provided a state-dependency (independent of that produced by neuropathy) allowing GBP to powerfully inhibit in normal uninjured animals. This circuit is therefore a crucial determinant of the abnormal neuronal and behavioural manifestations of neuropathy and importantly, the efficacy of gabapentin. As this spino-bulbo-spinal circuit contacts areas of the brain implicated in the affective components of pain, this loop may represent a route by which emotions can influence the degree of pain in a patient, as well as the effectiveness of the drug treatment. These hypotheses are testable in patients.},

It was assumed that the paroxysmal pain might be caused by nerve compression related to temporalis muscle hyperactivity. To lend support to this hypothesis, we also studied the anatomical relationship between the buccal nerve and the masticatory muscles. In this autopsy study, the buccal nerve pierced the temporalis muscle in six (12%) of 52 specimens from 26 cadavers.

  abstract        = {Convergence ratios between pre- and postsynaptic cells in the visual system vary widely between cell classes, areas of the visual field, between individuals and between species. Proper stabilization of the convergence and divergence of single visual neurons is critical for visual integration generally, and for specific functions such as those of rod and cone pathways, or the center and peripheral regions of the visual field. In early development, retinal ganglion cells, target cells and all their processes are produced in excess and stabilize at certain mature values. The intent of the investigations described here is to determine what features of cell connectivity are stabilized over normal variability by these developmental processes and how such stabilization is accomplished, using the developing mammalian retinotectal system as an example. Orderly compression of the retinotopic map into a half tectum was induced by a partial tectal ablation at birth in hamsters, increasing the ratio of retinal ganglion cells to superior colliculus target cells. The convergence problem is solved in this case by undersampling the spatial array with respect to normal, preserving local spatial resolution, but potentially reducing sensitivity or introducing aliasing artifacts. Receptive field sizes of single neurons are indistinguishable from normal, and reduction of branching of presynaptic axon arbors is the mechanism of the remapping. Behaviorally, though the entire visual field is still represented in the remaining colliculus, the solution has a cost in decreased probability and increased latency to orient to visual stimuli, particularly in the peripheral visual field. The generality of this solution for retinal and other central convergence regulation problems is evaluated.},

  abstract        = {Pregnant rats were injected on the 14th day of gestation with the cytotoxic drug methylazoxymethanol acetate. This compound causes the death of neural precursor cells that were synthesizing DNA at the time of injection. After birth, the progeny of treated mothers grew to maturity with a neocortex that was greatly reduced in area by the death of all cells, particularly at the frontal and occipital poles but at medial and lateral margins of neocortex as well. In the remaining cortex layers II through IV failed to develop. The experiment deprived growing thalamocortical axons, which innervate the somatic sensory cortex late in development, of part of their normal target area and of a substantial number of their definitive target cells. It also deprived them of any cues they might have received from these target cells migrating through them as the axons accumulate beneath the cortical plate. Anatomical experiments indicated that, despite these defects, thalamocortical axons could still colonize the sensorimotor areas and form synapses in their typically bilaminar pattern, though the outer, denser lamina of terminations occurred abnormally at the level of the apices of layer V pyramidal cell bodies. Receptive field mapping of single and multiunit responses in the somatic sensory region showed brisk responses and receptive fields of normal size. It also indicated the formation of a body map that was topographically intact except for deletions at its periphery; that is, a total map was not compressed into a smaller area. This suggests that somatic sensory thalamocortical fibers recognize only remaining cortical target cells in appropriate fields. Moreover, successful ones among them seem to recognize neighborhood relations and conserve synaptic space at the expense of those that would have innervated the deleted peripheral parts of the area. Pyramidal neurons in the remaining cortical layers and in ectopic islands of cells that had incompletely migrated from the neuroepithelium, probably on account of destruction of radial glial cell precursors, were shown by retrograde labeling to send their axons only to appropriate subcortical targets. Pyramidal neurons, though recognized as such, also adopted a variety of abnormal orientations, such as inversion, apparently in an attempt to grow apical dendrites toward major zones of synaptic terminations.},

  abstract        = {The successful reinnervation of peripheral targets after injury varies with the axonal population of the nerve that is injured and the extent of the dislocation of its central component from the peripheral endoneurial tube. Larger-diameter axons such as those supplying mechanoreceptors recover more readily than narrower axons such as those supplying taste. A complex, bi-directional interaction between lingual epithelium and sprouting nerve results in the redifferentiation of taste buds after denervation. Dentin and the dental pulp provide a strong attraction to sprouting nerves and will become reinnervated from collateral sources if recovery of the original innervation is blocked. The most effective repair technique for transected lingual nerves is one which brings the cut ends together rather than one that provides a temporary bridge. Injuries can result in cell death in the trigeminal ganglion but only if the injury is severe and recovery is prevented. Lesser damage results in chromatolysis and the increased expression of neuropeptides. All nerve injuries bring about changes in the trigeminal nucleus. These occur as changes in receptive field and the incidence of spontaneously active neurons, effects which are consistent with the unmasking of existing afferents. These functional changes are short-lived and reversible. Morphologically, nerve injury results in terminal degeneration in the nuclei and an increased expression of the c-Fos gene and some neuropeptides. Only a chronic constriction injury induces behavioral changes. The adult trigeminal system retains considerable plasticity that permits it to respond successfully to nerve injury. Much remains to be learned about this response, particularly of the trophic factors that control peripheral recovery and the central response to more severe injuries.},

  abstract        = {1. Previous work has indicated that nerve growth factor (NGF) is an important factor for the development of nociceptive A-delta fibers. Here we asked if the availability of NGF during the first 2 wk of development can influence the phenotypic development of unmyelinated afferent C-fibers. 2. To do this, we treated newborn rats with antibodies to NGF from postnatal day (PND) 2-14, a treatment known not to lead to cell death, or with exogenous NGF (PND 0-14). Untreated litter mates served as controls. When the animals were mature (5-20 wk later), they were anesthetized (urethan, 1.25 g/kg ip) and single-unit recordings were made from sural nerve C-fibers in dorsal root filaments. To obtain an unbiased estimate of the physiological types present, an electrocutaneous search technique was employed to isolate the location of the putative receptive field of the C-fiber being studied within the sural nerve territory. This technique enabled us to acquire a sample of C-fibers that was unbiased by natural search stimuli which are often damaging to skin. 3. We found that the proportion of C-fibers that could be driven by noxious heat and mechanical stimuli (C-mechanoheat fibers, C-MH) was reduced from 28% (11/40 fibers) of the sample in controls to 10% (3/31 fibers) in anti-NGF treated animals. The C-MH fibers appeared to have been replaced by a novel type of pressure receptor with an unusually low mechanical threshold (mean 0.86 +/- 0.58 compared with 13.0 +/- 8.3 g for control mechanonociceptors).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract        = {Rodents can robustly distinguish fine differences in texture using their whiskers, a capacity that depends on neuronal activity in primary somatosensory "barrel" cortex. Here we explore how texture was collectively encoded by populations of three to seven neuronal clusters simultaneously recorded from barrel cortex while a rat performed a discrimination task. Each cluster corresponded to the single-unit or multiunit activity recorded at an individual electrode. To learn how the firing of different clusters combines to represent texture, we computed population activity vectors across moving time windows and extracted the signal available in the optimal linear combination of clusters. We quantified this signal using receiver operating characteristic analysis and compared it to that available in single clusters. Texture encoding was heterogeneous across neuronal clusters, and only a minority of clusters carried signals strong enough to support stimulus discrimination on their own. However, jointly recorded groups of clusters were always able to support texture discrimination at a statistically significant level, even in sessions where no individual cluster represented the stimulus. The discriminative capacity of neuronal activity was degraded when error trials were included in the data, compared to only correct trials, suggesting a link between the neuronal activity and the animal's performance. These analyses indicate that small groups of barrel cortex neurons can robustly represent texture identity through synergistic interactions, and suggest that neurons downstream to barrel cortex could extract texture identity on single trials through simple linear combination of barrel cortex responses.},

Despite the ubiquity of adaptation, its effects on the stimulus information carried by neurons are often unknown. Here we examine how adaptation affects sensory coding in barrel cortex. We used spike-triggered covariance analysis of single-neuron responses to continuous, rapidly varying vibrissa motion stimuli, recorded in anesthetized rats. Changes in stimulus statistics induced spike rate adaptation over hundreds of milliseconds. Vibrissa motion encoding changed with adaptation as follows. In every neuron that showed rate adaptation, the input-output tuning function scaled with the changes in stimulus distribution, allowing the neurons to maintain the quantity of information conveyed about stimulus features. A single neuron that did not show rate adaptation also lacked input-output rescaling and did not maintain information across changes in stimulus statistics. Therefore, in barrel cortex, rate adaptation occurs on a slow timescale relative to the features driving spikes and is associated with gain rescaling matched to the stimulus distribution. Our results suggest that adaptation enhances tactile representations in primary somatosensory cortex, where they could directly influence perceptual decisions.},

  abstract     = {Calcium imaging is emerging as a popular technique in neuroscience. A major reason is that intracellular calcium transients are reflections of electrical events in neurons. For example, calcium influx in the soma and axonal boutons accompanies spiking activity, whereas elevations in dendrites and dendritic spines are associated with synaptic inputs and local regenerative events. However, calcium transients have complex spatiotemporal dynamics, and since most optical methods visualize only one of the somatic, axonal, and dendritic compartments, a straightforward inference of the underlying electrical event is typically challenging. We highlight experiments that have directly calibrated   calcium signals recorded using fluorescent indicators against electrophysiological events. We address commonly asked questions such as: Can calcium imaging be used to characterize neurons with high firing rates? Can the fluorescent signal report a decrease in spiking activity? What is the evidence that calcium transients in subcellular compartments correspond to distinct presynaptic axonal and postsynaptic dendritic events? By reviewing the empirical evidence and limitations, we suggest that, despite some caveats, calcium imaging is a versatile method to characterize a variety of neuronal events  .},

We mapped over 90,000 E and I synapses across twelve L2/3 PNs and uncovered structured organization of E and I synapses across dendritic domains as well as within individual dendritic segments. Despite significant domain-specific variation in the absolute density of E and I synapses, their ratio is strikingly balanced locally across dendritic segments. Computational modeling indicates that this spatially precise E/I balance dampens dendritic voltage fluctuations and strongly impacts neuronal firing output.},

  abstract     = {The perceptron learning algorithm and its multiple-layer extension, the backpropagation algorithm, are the foundations of the present-day machine learning revolution. However, these algorithms utilize a highly simplified mathematical abstraction of a neuron; it is not clear to what extent real biophysical neurons with morphologically-extended non-linear dendritic trees and conductance-based synapses can realize perceptron-like learning. Here we implemented the perceptron learning algorithm in a realistic biophysical model of a layer 5 cortical pyramidal cell with a full complement of non-linear dendritic channels. We tested this biophysical perceptron (BP) on a classification task, where it needed to correctly binarily classify 100, 1,000, or 2,000 patterns, and a generalization task, where it was required to discriminate between two "noisy" patterns. We show that the BP performs these tasks with an accuracy comparable to that of the original perceptron, though the classification capacity of the apical tuft is somewhat limited. We concluded that cortical pyramidal neurons can act as powerful classification devices.},

Here we combined electrophysiological and computational approaches to assess the functional organization of the IO nucleus in mice. Spontaneous fast and slow subthreshold events were commonly encountered during in vitro recordings. We show that whereas the fast events represent intrinsic regenerative activity, the slow events reflect the electrical connectivity between neurons ('spikelets'). Recordings from cell pairs revealed the synchronized occurrence of distinct groups of spikelets; their rate and distribution enabled an accurate estimation of the number of connected cells and is suggestive of a clustered organization. This study thus provides a new perspective on the functional and structural organization of the olivary nucleus and a novel experimental and theoretical approach to study electrically coupled networks.},

In terms of function, differences in the structure of the dendrites of these neurons appear to be crucial in determining how neurons integrate information. To further shed light on the structure of the human pyramidal neurons we investigated the geometry of pyramidal cells in the human and mouse CA1 region-one of the most evolutionary conserved archicortical regions, which is critically involved in the formation, consolidation, and retrieval of memory. We aimed to assess to what extent neurons corresponding to a homologous region in different species have parallel morphologies. Over 100 intracellularly injected and 3D-reconstructed cells across both species revealed that dendritic and axonal morphologies of human cells are not only larger but also have structural differences, when compared to mouse. The results show that human CA1 pyramidal cells are not a stretched version of mouse CA1 cells. These results indicate that there are some morphological parameters of the pyramidal cells that are conserved, whereas others are species-specific.},

Neuron_Reduce accelerates the simulations by 40-250 folds for a variety of cell types and realistic number (10,000-100,000) of synapses while closely replicating voltage dynamics and specific dendritic computations. The reduced neuron-models will enable realistic simulations of neural networks at unprecedented scale, including networks emerging from micro-connectomics efforts and biologically-inspired "deep networks".

  abstract     = {We present detailed models of pyramidal cells from human neocortex, including models on their excitatory synapses, dendritic spines, dendritic NMDA- and somatic/axonal   spikes that provided new insights into signal processing and computational capabilities of these principal cells. Six human layer 2 and layer 3 pyramidal cells (HL2/L3 PCs) were modeled, integrating detailed anatomical and physiological data from both fresh and postmortem tissues from human temporal cortex. The models predicted particularly large AMPA- and NMDA-conductances per synaptic contact (0.88 and 1.31 nS, respectively) and a steep dependence of the NMDA-conductance on voltage. These estimates were based on intracellular recordings from synaptically-connected HL2/L3 pairs, combined with extra-cellular current injections and use of synaptic blockers, and the assumption of five contacts per synaptic connection. A large dataset of high-resolution reconstructed HL2/L3 dendritic spines provided estimates for the EPSPs at the spine head (12.7 ± 4.6 mV), spine base (9.7 ± 5.0 mV), and soma (0.3 ± 0.1 mV), and for the spine neck resistance (50-80 MΩ). Matching the shape and firing pattern of experimental somatic  -spikes provided estimates for the density of the somatic/axonal excitable membrane ion channels, predicting that 134 ± 28 simultaneously activated HL2/L3-HL2/L3 synapses are required for generating (with 50% probability) a somatic   spike. Dendritic NMDA spikes were triggered in the model when 20 ± 10 excitatory spinous synapses were simultaneously activated on individual dendritic branches. The particularly large number of basal dendrites in HL2/L3 PCs and the distinctive cable elongation of their terminals imply that ~25 NMDA-spikes could be generated independently and simultaneously in these cells, as compared to ~14 in L2/3 PCs from the rat somatosensory cortex. These multi-sites non-linear signals, together with the large (~30,000) excitatory synapses/cell, equip human L2/L3 PCs with enhanced computational capabilities. Our study provides the most comprehensive model of any human neuron to-date demonstrating the biophysical and computational distinctiveness of human cortical neurons.},

Two previous studies characterized, in vivo, the receptive field (RF) of the vertical system (VS) cells of the blowfly (calliphora vicina), both intracellularly in the axon, and, independently using Ca  imaging, in hundreds of distal dendritic branchlets. We integrated this information into detailed passive cable and compartmental models of 3D reconstructed VS cells. Within a given VS cell type, the transfer resistance (TR) from different branchlets to the axon differs substantially, suggesting that they contribute unequally to the shaping of the axonal RF. Weighting the local RFs of all dendritic branchlets by their respective TR yielded a faithful reproduction of the axonal RF. The model also predicted that the various dendritic branchlets are electrically decoupled from each other, thus acting as independent local functional subunits. The study suggests that single neurons in the fly visual system filter dendritic noise and compute the weighted average of their inputs.},

  abstract        = {Understanding the computational implications of specific synaptic connectivity patterns is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. In particular, the computational role of ubiquitous electrical synapses operating via gap junctions remains elusive. In the fly visual system, the cells in the vertical-system network, which play a key role in visual processing, primarily connect to each other via axonal gap junctions. This network therefore provides a unique opportunity to explore the functional role of gap junctions in sensory information processing. Our information theoretical analysis of a realistic VS network model shows that within 10 ms following the onset of the visual input, the presence of axonal gap junctions enables the VS system to efficiently encode the axis of rotation, θ, of the fly's ego motion. This encoding efficiency, measured in bits, is near-optimal with respect to the physical limits of performance determined by the statistical structure of the visual input itself. The VS network is known to be connected to downstream pathways via a subset of triplets of the vertical system cells; we found that because of the axonal gap junctions, the efficiency of this subpopulation in encoding θ is superior to that of the whole vertical system network and is robust to a wide range of signal to noise ratios. We further demonstrate that this efficient encoding of motion by this subpopulation is necessary for the fly's visually guided behavior, such as banked turns in evasive maneuvers. Because gap junctions are formed among the axons of the vertical system cells, they only impact the system's readout, while maintaining the dendritic input intact, suggesting that the computational principles implemented by neural circuitries may be much richer than previously appreciated based on point neuron models. Our study provides new insights as to how specific network connectivity leads to efficient encoding of sensory stimuli.},

It plays a key role in synaptic plasticity and in single-neuron computations. Combining dynamic system theory and computational approaches, we now explore how the timing of synaptic inhibition affects the NMDA spike and its associated membrane current. When impinging on its early phase, individual inhibitory synapses strongly, but transiently, dampen the NMDA spike; later inhibition prematurely terminates it. A single inhibitory synapse reduces the NMDA-mediated Ca  current, a key player in plasticity, by up to 45%. NMDA spikes in distal dendritic branches/spines are longer-lasting and more resilient to inhibition, enhancing synaptic plasticity at these branches. We conclude that NMDA spikes are highly sensitive to dendritic inhibition; sparse weak inhibition can finely tune synaptic plasticity both locally at the dendritic branch level and globally at the level of the neuron's output.},

We employed feature-based statistical methods on a rare data set of 60 3D reconstructed pyramidal neurons from L2 and L3 in the human temporal cortex (HL2/L3 PCs) removed after brain surgery. Of these cells, 25 neurons were also characterized physiologically. Thirty-two morphological features were analyzed (e.g., dendritic surface area, 36 333 ± 18 157 μm2; number of basal trees, 5.55 ± 1.47; dendritic diameter, 0.76 ± 0.28 μm). Eighteen features showed a significant gradual increase with depth from the pia (e.g., dendritic length and soma radius). The other features showed weak or no correlation with depth (e.g., dendritic diameter). The basal dendritic terminals in HL2/L3 PCs are particularly elongated, enabling multiple nonlinear processing units in these dendrites. Unlike the morphological features, the active biophysical features (e.g., spike shapes and rates) and passive/cable features (e.g., somatic input resistance, 47.68 ± 15.26 MΩ, membrane time constant, 12.03 ± 1.79 ms, average dendritic cable length, 0.99 ± 0.24) were depth-independent. A novel descriptor for apical dendritic topology yielded 2 distinct classes, termed hereby as "slim-tufted" and "profuse-tufted" HL2/L3 PCs; the latter class tends to fire at higher rates. Thus, our morpho-electrotonic analysis shows 2 distinct classes of HL2/L3 PCs.},

  abstract        = {Uncovering structural regularities and architectural topologies of cortical circuitry is vital for understanding neural computations. Recently, an experimentally constrained algorithm generated a dense network reconstruction of a ∼0.3-mm  volume from juvenile rat somatosensory neocortex, comprising ∼31,000 cells and ∼36 million synapses. Using this reconstruction, we found a small-world topology with an average of 2.5 synapses separating any two cells and multiple cell-type-specific wiring features. Amounts of excitatory and inhibitory innervations varied across cells, yet pyramidal neurons maintained relatively constant excitation/inhibition ratios. The circuit contained highly connected hub neurons belonging to a small subset of cell types and forming an interconnected cell-type-specific rich club. Certain three-neuron motifs were overrepresented, matching recent experimental results. Cell-type-specific network properties were even more striking when synaptic strength and sign were considered in generating a functional topology. Our systematic approach enables interpretation of microconnectomics 'big data' and provides several experimentally testable predictions.},

The impact of multiple GJs on the biophysical properties of interneurons and thus on their input processing is unclear. The present experimentally based theoretical study examined GJs in L2/3 large basket cells (L2/3 LBCs) with 3 goals in mind: (1) To evaluate the errors due to GJs in estimating the cable properties of individual L2/3 LBCs and suggest ways to correct these errors when modeling these cells and the networks they form; (2) to bracket the GJ conductance value (0.05-0.25 nS) and membrane resistivity (10 000-40 000 Ω cm(2)) of L2/3 LBCs; these estimates are tightly constrained by in vitro input resistance (131 ± 18.5 MΩ) and the coupling coefficient (1-3.5%) of these cells; and (3) to explore the functional implications of GJs, and show that GJs: (i) dynamically modulate the effective time window for synaptic integration; (ii) improve the axon's capability to encode rapid changes in synaptic inputs; and (iii) reduce the orientation selectivity, linearity index, and phase difference of L2/3 LBCs. Our study provides new insights into the role of GJs and calls for caution when using in vitro measurements for modeling electrically coupled neuronal networks.},

However, it is not known whether the basic building blocks of the human neocortex, the pyramidal neurons, possess unique biophysical properties that might impact on cortical computations. Here we show that layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons from human temporal cortex (HL2/3 PCs) have a specific membrane capacitance ( ) of ~0.5 µF/cm , half of the commonly accepted 'universal' value (~1 µF/cm ) for biological membranes. This finding was predicted by fitting in vitro voltage transients to theoretical transients then validated by direct measurement of   in nucleated patch experiments. Models of 3D reconstructed HL2/3 PCs demonstrated that such low   value significantly enhances both synaptic charge-transfer from dendrites to soma and spike propagation along the axon. This is the first demonstration that human cortical neurons have distinctive membrane properties, suggesting important implications for signal processing in human neocortex.},

  abstract     = {At many scales in neuroscience, appropriate mathematical models take the form of complex dynamical systems. Parameterizing such models to conform to the multitude of available experimental constraints is a global non-linear optimisation problem with a complex fitness landscape, requiring numerical techniques to find suitable approximate solutions. Stochastic optimisation approaches, such as evolutionary algorithms, have been shown to be effective, but often the setting up of such optimisations and the choice of a specific search algorithm and its parameters is non-trivial, requiring domain-specific expertise. Here we describe BluePyOpt, a Python package targeted at the broad neuroscience community to simplify this task. BluePyOpt is an extensible framework for data-driven model parameter optimisation that wraps and standardizes several existing open-source tools. It simplifies the task of creating and sharing these optimisations, and the associated techniques and knowledge. This is achieved by abstracting the optimisation and evaluation tasks into various reusable and flexible discrete elements according to established best-practices. Further, BluePyOpt provides methods for setting up both small- and large-scale optimisations on a variety of platforms, ranging from laptops to Linux clusters and cloud-based compute infrastructures. The versatility of the BluePyOpt framework is demonstrated by working through three representative neuroscience specific use cases.},

Our knowledge on neuronal structure and function is primarily based on brains of laboratory animals. Whether it translates to human is not known since quantitative data on "full" human neuronal morphologies are lacking. Here, we obtained human brain tissue during resection surgery and reconstructed basal and apical dendrites and axons of individual neurons across all cortical layers in temporal cortex (Brodmann area 21). Importantly, morphologies did not correlate to etiology, disease severity, or disease duration. Next, we show that human L(ayer) 2 and L3 pyramidal neurons have 3-fold larger dendritic length and increased branch complexity with longer segments compared with temporal cortex neurons from macaque and mouse. Unsupervised cluster analysis classified 88% of human L2 and L3 neurons into human-specific clusters distinct from mouse and macaque neurons. Computational modeling of passive electrical properties to assess the functional impact of large dendrites indicates stronger signal attenuation of electrical inputs compared with mouse. We thus provide a quantitative analysis of "full" human neuron morphologies and present direct evidence that human neurons are not "scaled-up" versions of rodent or macaque neurons, but have unique structural and functional properties.},

Based on in vivo and in vitro recordings, and 3D reconstructions of connected pairs of L2/3 PCs, our model predicts that: 1) AMPAR and NMDAR conductances/synapse are 0.52 ± 0.24 and 0.40 ± 0.34 nS, respectively; 2) following WD, connection between L2/3 PCs induces a composite EPSPs of 7.6 ± 1.7 mV, well below the threshold for action potential (AP) initiation; 3) together with the excitatory feedforward L4-to-L2/3 connection, WD evoked a composite EPSP of 16.3 ± 3.5 mV and a probability of 0.01 to generate an AP. When considering the variability in L4 spiny neurons responsiveness, it increased to 17.8 ± 11.2 mV; this 3-fold increase in the SD yielded AP probability of 0.35; 4) the interaction between L4-to-L2/3 and L2/3-to-L2/3 inputs is highly nonlinear; 5) L2/3 dendritic morphology significantly affects L2/3 PCs responsiveness. We conclude that early stages of intracortical signaling of WD are dominated by a combination of feedforward L4-L2/3 and L2/3-L2/3 lateral connections.},

Synaptic plasticity enables this by strenghtening a subset of synapses that are, presumably, functionally relevant to the neuron. A different selection mechanism exploits the resonance of the dendritic membranes to preferentially filter synaptic inputs based on their temporal rates. A widely held view is that a neuron has one resonant frequency and thus can pass through one rate. Here we demonstrate through mathematical analyses and numerical simulations that dendritic resonance is inevitably a spatially distributed property; and therefore the resonance frequency varies along the dendrites, and thus endows neurons with a powerful spatiotemporal selection mechanism that is sensitive both to the dendritic location and the temporal structure of the incoming synaptic inputs.},

  abstract        = {This study highlights a new and powerful direct impact of the dendritic tree (the input region of neurons) on the encoding capability of the axon (the output region). We show that the size of the dendritic arbors (its impedance load) strongly modulates the shape of the action potential (AP) onset at the axon initial segment; it is accelerated in neurons with larger dendritic surface area. AP onset rapidness is key in determining the capability of the axonal spikes to encode (phase lock to) rapid changes in synaptic inputs. Hence, our findings imply that neurons with larger dendritic arbors have improved encoding capabilities. This "dendritic size effect" was explored both analytically as well as numerically, in simplified and detailed models of 3D reconstructed layer 2/3 cortical pyramidal cells of rats and humans. The cutoff frequency of spikes phase locking to modulated inputs increased from 100 to 200 Hz in pyramidal cells of young rats to 400-600 Hz in human cells. In the latter case, phase locking reached close to 1 KHz in in vivo-like conditions. This work highlights new and functionally profound cross talk between the dendritic tree and the axon initial segment, providing new understanding of neurons as sophisticated nonlinear input/output devices.},

  abstract        = {Although the diversity of cortical interneuron electrical properties is well recognized, the number of distinct electrical types (e-types) is still a matter of debate. Recently, descriptions of interneuron variability were standardized by multiple laboratories on the basis of a subjective classification scheme as set out by the Petilla convention (Petilla Interneuron Nomenclature Group, PING). Here, we present a quantitative, statistical analysis of a database of nearly five hundred neurons manually annotated according to the PING nomenclature. For each cell, 38 features were extracted from responses to suprathreshold current stimuli and statistically analyzed to examine whether cortical interneurons subdivide into e-types. We showed that the partitioning into different e-types is indeed the major component of data variability. The analysis suggests refining the PING e-type classification to be hierarchical, whereby most variability is first captured within a coarse subpartition, and then subsequently divided into finer subpartitions. The coarse partition matches the well-known partitioning of interneurons into fast spiking and adapting cells. Finer subpartitions match the burst, continuous, and delayed subtypes. Additionally, our analysis enabled the ranking of features according to their ability to differentiate among e-types. We showed that our quantitative e-type assignment is more than 90% accurate and manages to catch several human errors.},

This activity, described as spontaneous slow waves in membrane potential, has been observed in a span of species in diverse cortical and subcortical areas. We here characterized membrane potential fluctuations in motor and the frontal association cortices cortical neurons of ketamine-xylazine anesthetized rats. We recorded from 95 neurons from a range of cortical depths to unravel the network and cellular mechanisms that shape the subthreshold ongoing spontaneous activity of these neurons. We define a unitary event that generates the subthreshold ongoing activity: giant synaptic potentials (GSPs). These events have a duration of 87 ± 50 ms and an amplitude of 19 ± 6.4 mV. They occur at a frequency of 3.7 ± 0.8 Hz and involve an increase in conductance change of 22 ± 21%. GSPs are mainly due to excitatory activity that occurs throughout all cortical layers, unaffected by the intrinsic properties of the cells. Indeed, blocking the GABAA receptors, a procedure that had a profound effect on cortical activity, did not alter these unitary events. We propose that this unitary event is composed of individual, excitatory synaptic potentials that appear at different levels of synchrony and that the level of synchrony determines the shape of the subthreshold activity.},

We systematically characterized the dependence of excitatory synaptic plasticity on dendritic morphology, loci and strength, as well as on the spatial distribution of inhibitory synapses and on the level of excitatory activity. Plasticity of excitatory synapses may attain three states: "protected" (unchanged), potentiated (long-term potentiation; LTP), or depressed (long-term depression; LTD). The transition between these three plasticity states could be finely tuned by synaptic inhibition with high spatial resolution. Strategic placement of inhibition could give rise to the co-existence of all three states over short dendritic branches. We compared the plasticity effect of the innervation patterns typical of different inhibitory subclasses-Chandelier, Basket, Martinotti, and Double Bouquet-in a detailed model of a layer 5 pyramidal cell. Our study suggests that dendritic inhibition plays a key role in shaping and fine-tuning excitatory synaptic plasticity in dendrites.},

To quantify the effect of this morphological variability on the firing of layer 5 thick-tufted pyramidal cells (TTCs), a detailed conductance-based model was constructed for a three-dimensional reconstructed exemplar TTC. The model exhibited spike initiation in the axon and reproduced the characteristic features of individual spikes, as well as of the firing properties at the soma, as recorded in a population of TTCs in young Wistar rats. When using these model parameters over the population of 28 three-dimensional reconstructed TTCs, both axonal and somatic ion channel densities had to be scaled linearly with the conductance load imposed on each of these compartments. Otherwise, the firing of model cells deviated, sometimes very significantly, from the experimental variability of the TTC e-class. The study provides experimentally testable predictions regarding the coregulation of axosomatic membrane ion channels density for cells with different dendritic conductance load, together with a simple and systematic method for generating reliable conductance-based models for the whole population of modeled neurons belonging to a particular e-class, with variable morphology as found experimentally.},

Typically, an inhibitory axon contacts a particular dendritic subdomain of its target neuron, where it often makes 10-20 synapses, sometimes on very distal branches. The functional implications of such a connectivity pattern are not well understood. Our experimentally based theoretical study highlights several new and counterintuitive principles for dendritic inhibition. We show that distal "off-path" rather than proximal "on-path" inhibition effectively dampens proximal excitable dendritic "hotspots," thus powerfully controlling the neuron's output. Additionally, with multiple synaptic contacts, inhibition operates globally, spreading centripetally hundreds of micrometers from the inhibitory synapses. Consequently, inhibition in regions lacking inhibitory synapses may exceed that at the synaptic sites themselves. These results offer new insights into the synergetic effect of dendritic inhibition in controlling dendritic excitability and plasticity and in dynamically molding functional dendritic subdomains and their output.},

  abstract     = {The fibers in a skeletal muscle are divided into groups called "muscle units" whereby each muscle unit is innervated by a single neuron. It was found that neurons with low activation thresholds have smaller muscle units than neurons with higher activation thresholds. This results in a fixed recruitment order of muscle units, from smallest to largest, called the "size principle." It is thought that the size principle results from a competitive process-taking place after birth-between the neurons innervating the muscle. The underlying mechanism of the competition was not understood. Moreover, the results in the majority of experiments that manipulated the activity during the competition period seemed to contradict the size principle. Experiments at the isolated muscle fibers showed that the competition is governed by a Hebbian-like rule, whereby neurons with low activation thresholds have a competitive advantage at any single muscle fiber. Thus neurons with low activation thresholds are expected to have larger muscle units in contradiction to what is seen empirically. This state of affairs was termed "paradoxical." In the present study we developed a new game theoretic framework to analyze such competitive biological processes. In this game, neurons are the players competing to innervate a maximal number of muscle fibers. We showed that in order to innervate more muscle fibers, it is advantageous to win (as the neurons with higher activation thresholds do) later competitions. This both explains the size principle and resolves the seemingly paradoxical experimental data. Our model establishes that the competition at each muscle fiber may indeed be Hebbian and that the size principle still emerges from these competitions as an overall property of the system. Thus, the less active neurons "lose the battle but win the war." Our model provides experimentally testable predictions. The new game-theoretic approach may be applied to competitions in other biological systems.},

  abstract        = {It is commonly accepted that the Inferior Olive (IO) provides a timing signal to the cerebellum. Stable subthreshold oscillations in the IO can facilitate accurate timing by phase-locking spikes to the peaks of the oscillation. Several theoretical models accounting for the synchronized subthreshold oscillations have been proposed, however, two experimental observations remain an enigma. The first is the observation of frequent alterations in the frequency of the oscillations. The second is the observation of constant phase differences between simultaneously recorded neurons. In order to account for these two observations we constructed a canonical network model based on anatomical and physiological data from the IO. The constructed network is characterized by clustering of neurons with similar conductance densities, and by electrical coupling between neurons. Neurons inside a cluster are densely connected with weak strengths, while neurons belonging to different clusters are sparsely connected with stronger connections. We found that this type of network can robustly display stable subthreshold oscillations. The overall frequency of the network changes with the strength of the inter-cluster connections, and phase differences occur between neurons of different clusters. Moreover, the phase differences provide a mechanistic explanation for the experimentally observed propagating waves of activity in the IO. We conclude that the architecture of the network of electrically coupled neurons in combination with modulation of the inter-cluster coupling strengths can account for the experimentally observed frequency changes and the phase differences.},

Traditionally, various current waveforms have been injected at the soma to probe neuron dynamics, but the rationale for selecting specific stimuli has never been rigorously justified. The present experimental and theoretical study proposes a novel framework, inspired by learning theory, for objectively selecting the stimuli that best unravel the neuron's dynamics. The efficacy of stimuli is assessed in terms of their ability to constrain the parameter space of biophysically detailed conductance-based models that faithfully replicate the neuron's dynamics as attested by their ability to generalize well to the neuron's response to novel experimental stimuli. We used this framework to evaluate a variety of stimuli in different types of cortical neurons, ages and animals. Despite their simplicity, a set of stimuli consisting of step and ramp current pulses outperforms synaptic-like noisy stimuli in revealing the dynamics of these neurons. The general framework that we propose paves a new way for defining, evaluating and standardizing effective electrical probing of neurons and will thus lay the foundation for a much deeper understanding of the electrical nature of these highly sophisticated and non-linear devices and of the neuronal networks that they compose.},

L5b pyramidal cells have been the subject of extensive experimental and modeling studies, yet conductance-based models of these cells that faithfully reproduce both their perisomatic Na(+)-spiking behavior as well as key dendritic active properties, including Ca(2+) spikes and back-propagating action potentials, are still lacking. Based on a large body of experimental recordings from both the soma and dendrites of L5b pyramidal cells in adult rats, we characterized key features of the somatic and dendritic firing and quantified their statistics. We used these features to constrain the density of a set of ion channels over the soma and dendritic surface via multi-objective optimization with an evolutionary algorithm, thus generating a set of detailed conductance-based models that faithfully replicate the back-propagating action potential activated Ca(2+) spike firing and the perisomatic firing response to current steps, as well as the experimental variability of the properties. Furthermore, we show a useful way to analyze model parameters with our sets of models, which enabled us to identify some of the mechanisms responsible for the dynamic properties of L5b pyramidal cells as well as mechanisms that are sensitive to morphological changes. This automated framework can be used to develop a database of faithful models for other neuron types. The models we present provide several experimentally-testable predictions and can serve as a powerful tool for theoretical investigations of the contribution of single-cell dynamics to network activity and its computational capabilities.},

  abstract        = {Neocortical layer 5 (L5) pyramidal cells have at least two spike initiation zones: Na(+) spikes are generated near the soma, and Ca(2+) spikes at the apical dendritic tuft. These spikes interact with each other and serve as signals for synaptic plasticity. The present computational study explores the implications of having two spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) signals in a neuron, each with its respective regional population of synaptic "pupils." In a detailed model of an L5 pyramidal neuron, competition emerges between synapses belonging to different regions, on top of the competition among synapses within each region, which characterizes the STDP mechanism. Interregional competition results in strengthening of one group of synapses, which ultimately dominates cell firing, at the expense of weakening synapses in other regions. This novel type of competition is inherent to dendrites with multiple regional signals for Hebbian plasticity. Surprisingly, such interregional competition exists even in a simplified model of two identical coupled compartments. We find that in a model of an L5 pyramidal cell, the different synaptic subpopulations "live in peace" when the induction of Ca(2+) spikes requires the back-propagating action potential (BPAP). Thus we suggest a new key role for the BPAP, to maintain the balance between synaptic efficacies throughout the dendritic tree, thereby sustaining the functional integrity of the entire neuron.},

We show that even if the initial strength, g(peak), of distal synapses is augmented in a location independent manner, the efficacy of distal synapses diminishes following STDP and proximal synapses would eventually dominate. Indeed, proximal synapses always win over distal synapses following linear STDP rule, independent of the initial synaptic strength distribution in the dendritic tree. This effect is more pronounced as the dendritic cable length increases but it does not depend on the dendritic branching structure. Adding a small multiplicative component to the linear STDP rule, whereby already strong synapses tend to be less potentiated than depressed (and vice versa for weak synapses) did partially "save" distal synapses from "dying out." Another successful strategy for balancing the efficacy of distal and proximal synapses following STDP is to increase the upper bound for the synaptic conductance (g(max)) with distance from the soma. We conclude by discussing an experiment for assessing which of these possible strategies might actually operate in dendrites.},

  abstract        = {Neuron models, in particular conductance-based compartmental models, often have numerous parameters that cannot be directly determined experimentally and must be constrained by an optimization procedure. A common practice in evaluating the utility of such procedures is using a previously developed model to generate surrogate data (e.g., traces of spikes following step current pulses) and then challenging the algorithm to recover the original parameters (e.g., the value of maximal ion channel conductances) that were used to generate the data. In this fashion, the success or failure of the model fitting procedure to find the original parameters can be easily determined. Here we show that some model fitting procedures that provide an excellent fit in the case of such model-to-model comparisons provide ill-balanced results when applied to experimental data. The main reason is that surrogate and experimental data test different aspects of the algorithm's function. When considering model-generated surrogate data, the algorithm is required to locate a perfect solution that is known to exist. In contrast, when considering experimental target data, there is no guarantee that a perfect solution is part of the search space. In this case, the optimization procedure must rank all imperfect approximations and ultimately select the best approximation. This aspect is not tested at all when considering surrogate data since at least one perfect solution is known to exist (the original parameters) making all approximations unnecessary. Furthermore, we demonstrate that distance functions based on extracting a set of features from the target data (such as time-to-first-spike, spike width, spike frequency, etc.)--rather than using the original data (e.g., the whole spike trace) as the target for fitting-are capable of finding imperfect solutions that are good approximations of the experimental data.},

Both have stochastic components that are reflected in random fluctuations of the membrane potential. We measured the spectral characteristics of membrane voltage noise in vitro at the soma and the apical dendrite of layer 4/5 (L4/5) neocortical neurons of rats near the resting potential. We found a remarkable similarity between the voltage noise power spectra at the soma and the dendrites, despite a marked difference in their respective input impedances. At both sites, the noise levels and the input impedance are voltage dependent; in the soma, the noise level increased from sigma = 0.33 +/- 0.28 mV at 10 mV hyperpolarization from the resting potential to sigma = 0.59 +/- 0.3 at a depolarization of 10 mV. At the dendrite, the noise increased from sigma = 0.34 +/- 0.28 to sigma = 0.56 +/- 0.30 mV, respectively. TTX reduced both the input impedance and the voltage noise, and eliminated their voltage dependence at both locations. We describe a detailed compartmental model of a L4/5 neuron with simplified electrical properties that successfully reproduces the difference in input impedance between dendrites and soma and demonstrates that spatially uniform conductance-base noise sources leads to an apparent isopotential structure which exhibits a uniform power spectra of voltage noise at all locations. We speculate that a homogeneous distribution of noise sources insures that variability in synaptic amplitude as well as timing of action potentials is location invariant.},

Such global scaling preserves the relative strengths of synapses and thus keeps 'Hebbian-like' memory traces (long-term potentiations, LTP, or depressions, LTD). However, new experimental findings demonstrate that HSP can operate locally, controlling each synapse individually. Seemingly, this finding implies that HSP can abolish any modification of synaptic strength (erase LTP/LTD). We propose that dendrites offer an inherent solution to this 'paradox' and that in fact local HSP might confer upon the neuron several surprising benefits, which are demonstrated using computer simulations.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel framework for automatically constraining parameters of compartmental models of neurons, given a large set of experimentally measured responses of these neurons. In experiments, intrinsic noise gives rise to a large variability (e.g., in firing pattern) in the voltage responses to repetitions of the exact same input. Thus, the common approach of fitting models by attempting to perfectly replicate, point by point, a single chosen trace out of the spectrum of variable responses does not seem to do justice to the data. In addition, finding a single error function that faithfully characterizes the distance between two spiking traces is not a trivial pursuit. To address these issues, one can adopt a multiple objective optimization approach that allows the use of several error functions jointly. When more than one error function is available, the comparison between experimental voltage traces and model response can be performed on the basis of individual features of interest (e.g., spike rate, spike width). Each feature can be compared between model and experimental mean, in units of its experimental variability, thereby incorporating into the fitting this variability. We demonstrate the success of this approach, when used in conjunction with genetic algorithm optimization, in generating an excellent fit between model behavior and the firing pattern of two distinct electrical classes of cortical interneurons, accommodating and fast-spiking. We argue that the multiple, diverse models generated by this method could serve as the building blocks for the realistic simulation of large neuronal networks.},

It is based first on a detailed morphological and functional characterization of synaptically connected pairs of L4-L2/3 neurons from in vitro recordings and second, on in vivo recordings of voltage responses of L2/3 pyramidal cells to current pulses and to whisker deflection. In vitro data and a detailed compartmental model of L2/3 pyramidal cells enabled us to extract their specific membrane resistivity ( approximately 16,000 ohms x cm(2)) and capacitance ( approximately 0.8 microF/cm(2)) and the spatial distribution of L4-L2/3 synaptic contacts. The average peak conductance per L4 synaptic contact is 0.26 nS for the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid and 0.2 nS for NMDA receptors. The in vivo voltage response for current steps was then used to calibrate the model for in vivo conditions in the Down state. Consequently, the effect of a single whisker deflection was modeled by converging, on average, 350 +/- 20 L4 axons onto the modeled L2/3 pyramidal cell. Based on values of synaptic conductance, the spatial distribution of L4 synapses on L2/3 dendrites, and the average in vivo spiking probability of L4 spiny neurons, the model predicts that the feed-forward L4-L2/3 connection on its own does not fire the L2/3 neuron. With a broader distribution in the number of L4 neurons or with slight synchrony among them, the L2/3 model does spike with low probability.},

This study uses a detailed model of spiny stellate cells (SSCs) from cat area 17 to explain this property. The model integrates our experimental data, including morphological and intrinsic membrane properties and the number and spatial distribution of four major synaptic input sources of the SSC: the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and three cortical sources. The model also includes synaptic properties of these inputs. The cortical input served as sources of background activity, and visual stimuli was modeled as sinusoidal grating. For all contrasts, strong synaptic depression of the dLGN feedforward afferents compresses the firing rates in response to orthogonal stimuli, keeping these rates at practically the same low level. However, at preferred orientations, despite synaptic depression, firing rate changes as a function of contrast. Thus, when embedded in an active network, strong synaptic depression can explain contrast-invariant orientation tuning of simple cells. This is true also when the dLGN inputs are partially depressed as a result of their spontaneous activity and to some extent also when parameters were fitted to a more moderate level of synaptic depression. The model response is in close agreement with experimental results, in terms of both output spikes and membrane voltage (amplitude and fluctuations), with reasonable exceptions given that recurrent connections were not incorporated.},

We show that dendritic branching topology can be well described by minimizing the path length from the neuron's dendritic root to each of its synaptic inputs while constraining the total length of wiring. Tapering of diameter toward the dendrite tip--a feature of many neurons--optimizes charge transfer from all dendritic synapses to the dendritic root while housekeeping the amount of dendrite volume. As an example, we show how dendrites of fly neurons can be closely reconstructed based on these two principles alone.},

  abstract        = {Complex flight maneuvers require a sophisticated system to exploit the optic flow resulting from moving images of the environment projected onto the retina. In the fly's visual course control center, the lobula plate, 10 so-called vertical system (VS) cells are thought to match, with their complex receptive fields, the optic flow resulting from rotation around different body axes. However, signals of single VS cells are unreliable indicators of such optic flow parameters in the context of their noisy, texture-dependent input from local motion measurements. Here we propose an alternative encoding scheme based on network simulations of biophysically realistic compartmental models of VS cells. The simulations incorporate recent data about the highly selective connectivity between VS cells consisting of an electrical axo-axonal coupling between adjacent cells and a reciprocal inhibition between the most distant cells. We find that this particular wiring performs a linear interpolation between the output signals of VS cells, leading to a robust representation of the axis of rotation even in the presence of textureless patches of the visual surround.},

A detailed model of a CA1 pyramidal neuron, with numerous HSP-modifiable dendritic synapses, demonstrates that HSP may have an important role in selecting which spatial patterns of LTP/LTD are to last. Several measures are developed for predicting the net residual potentiation/depression after HSP from the initial spatial pattern of LTP/LTD. Under a local dendritic HSP mechanism, sparse patterns of LTP/LTD, which we show, using information theoretical tools, to have a significant impact on the output of the postsynaptic neuron, will persist. In contrast, spatially clustered patterns with a smaller impact on the output will diminish. A global somatic HSP mechanism, conversely, will favor distally occurring LTP/LTDs over proximal ones. Despite the negative-feedback nature of HSP, under both local and global HSP, numerous synaptic potentiations/depressions can persist. These experimentally testable results imply that HSP could be significantly involved in shaping the spatial distribution of synaptic weights in the dendrites and not just normalizing it, as is currently believed.},

  abstract        = {Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) is an important mechanism attributed with the slow regulation of the neuron's activity. Whenever activity is chronically enhanced, HSP weakens the weights of the synapses in the dendrites and vice versa. Because dendritic morphology and its electrical properties partition the dendritic tree into functional compartments, we set out to explore the interplay between HSP and dendritic compartmentalization. For this purpose, we used a detailed model of a CA1 pyramidal neuron receiving a large number of activity-dependent plastic synapses and developed a novel approach for specifying functional dendritic subunits. We found that the degree of dendritic compartmentalization and the location-specificity of HSP are strongly tied. A local HSP mechanism, operating at the level of the individual synapse, will regard the neuron as a multiunit distributed system, each unit consisting of many synapses, and will thus support dendritic compartmentalization, whereas a global HSP mechanism, modifying all synapses in unison, will treat the neuron as a single centralized unit. Both local and global HSP can successfully counterbalance persistent, cell-wide perturbations of dendritic activity. The spatial distribution of synaptic weights throughout the dendrites will markedly differ under the local versus global HSP mechanisms. We suggest an experimental paradigm to unravel which type of HSP mechanism operates in the dendritic tree. The answer to this question will have important implications to our understanding of the functional organization of the neuron.},

We numerically simulate the effects of stochastic ion channels on the forward and backward propagation of dendritic spikes in Monte-Carlo simulations on a reconstructed layer 5 pyramidal neuron. We report that in most instances there is little variation in timing or amplitude for a single BPAP, while variable backpropagation can occur for trains of action potentials. Additionally, we find that the generation and forward propagation of dendritic Ca(2+) spikes are susceptible to channel variability. This indicates limitations on computations that depend on the precise timing of Ca(2+) spikes.},

Such apparent depression is most notable for slow synaptic conductance changes, for high frequency, and when the synapse is located at distal dendritic sites. We show that, when temporal summation ensues, the erroneous estimation of short-term synaptic plasticity arises partially from the conventional measurement of synaptic dynamics at postsynaptic potential peak time. This can be corrected when measuring overlapping synaptic responses at fixed intervals after stimulus time. Somatic voltage clamp also helps to partially correct for the apparent depression, but a good model of the neuron can do even better in providing a more accurate view of the underlying synaptic conductances.},

These fluctuations limit the accuracy of a neurone's output but have also been suggested to play a computational role. We present a detailed study of the amplitude and spectrum of voltage noise recorded at the soma of layer IV-V pyramidal neurones in slices taken from rat neocortex. The dependence of the noise on holding potential, synaptic activity and Na+ conductance is systematically analysed. We demonstrate that voltage noise increases non-linearly as the cell depolarizes (from a standard deviation (s.d.) of 0.19 mV at -75 mV to an s.d. of 0.54 mV at -55 mV). The increase in voltage noise is accompanied by an increase in the cell impedance, due to voltage dependence of Na+ conductance. The impedance increase accounts for the majority (70%) of the voltage noise increase. The increase in voltage noise and impedance is restricted to the low-frequency range (0.2-2 Hz). At the high frequency range (5-100 Hz) the voltage noise is dominated by synaptic activity. In our slice preparation, synaptic noise has little effect on the cell impedance. A minimal model reproduces qualitatively these data. Our results imply that ion channel noise contributes significantly to membrane voltage fluctuations at the subthreshold voltage range, and that Na+ conductance plays a key role in determining the amplitude of this noise by acting as a voltage-dependent amplifier of low-frequency transients.},

We studied the role of gamma-frequency (~40 Hz) synchrony between prefrontal parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in mice learning multiple new cue-reward associations. Voltage indicators revealed cell-type-specific increases of cross-hemispheric gamma synchrony between PV interneurons when mice received feedback that previously learned associations were no longer valid. Disrupting this synchronization by delivering out-of-phase optogenetic stimulation caused mice to perseverate on outdated associations, an effect not reproduced by in-phase stimulation or out-of-phase stimulation at other frequencies. Gamma synchrony was specifically required when new associations used familiar cues that were previously irrelevant to behavioral outcomes, not when associations involved new cues or for reversing previously learned associations. Thus, gamma synchrony is indispensable for reappraising the behavioral salience of external cues.},

  abstract        = {How the brain processes information accurately despite stochastic neural activity is a longstanding question . For instance, perception is fundamentally limited by the information that the brain can extract from the noisy dynamics of sensory neurons. Seminal experiments  suggest that correlated noise in sensory cortical neural ensembles is what limits their coding accuracy , although how correlated noise affects neural codes remains debated . Recent theoretical work proposes that how a neural ensemble's sensory tuning properties relate statistically to its correlated noise patterns is a greater determinant of coding accuracy than is absolute noise strength . However, without simultaneous recordings from thousands of cortical neurons with shared sensory inputs, it is unknown whether correlated noise limits coding fidelity. Here we present a 16-beam, two-photon microscope to monitor activity across the mouse primary visual cortex, along with analyses to quantify the information conveyed by large neural ensembles. We found that, in the visual cortex, correlated noise constrained signalling for ensembles with 800-1,300 neurons. Several noise components of the ensemble dynamics grew proportionally to the ensemble size and the encoded visual signals, revealing the predicted information-limiting correlations . Notably, visual signals were perpendicular to the largest noise mode, which therefore did not limit coding fidelity. The information-limiting noise modes were approximately ten times smaller and concordant with mouse visual acuity . Therefore, cortical design principles appear to enhance coding accuracy by restricting around 90% of noise fluctuations to modes that do not limit signalling fidelity, whereas much weaker correlated noise modes inherently bound sensory discrimination.},

  abstract        = {Brain circuits comprise vast numbers of interconnected neurons with diverse molecular, anatomical and physiological properties. To allow targeting of individual neurons for structural and functional studies, we created light-inducible site-specific DNA recombinases based on Cre, Dre and Flp (RecVs). RecVs can induce genomic modifications by one-photon or two-photon light induction in vivo. They can produce targeted, sparse and strong labeling of individual neurons by modifying multiple loci within mouse and zebrafish genomes. In combination with other genetic strategies, they allow intersectional targeting of different neuronal classes. In the mouse cortex they enable sparse labeling and whole-brain morphological reconstructions of individual neurons. Furthermore, these enzymes allow single-cell two-photon targeted genetic modifications and can be used in combination with functional optical indicators with minimal interference. In summary, RecVs enable spatiotemporally precise optogenomic modifications that can facilitate detailed single-cell analysis of neural circuits by linking genetic identity, morphology, connectivity and function.},

This paradigm has been dominant for decades in primate motor neuroscience. Our device can generate arbitrary virtual movement tracks, arbitrary time-varying forces or arbitrary position- or velocity-dependent force patterns. We describe several example tasks permitted by our device, including linear movements, movement sequences and aiming movements. We provide the mechanical drawings and source code needed to assemble and control the device, and detail the procedure to train mice to use the device. Our software can be simply extended to allow users to program various customized movement assays. The device can be assembled in a few days, and the time to train mice on the tasks that we describe ranges from a few days to several weeks.

Effective diagnosis of ALS and quantitative monitoring of its progression are crucial to the success of clinical trials. Second harmonic generation (SHG) microendoscopy is an emerging technology for imaging single motor unit contractions. To assess the potential value of microendoscopy for diagnosing and tracking ALS, we monitored motor unit dynamics in a B6.SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS for several weeks. Prior to overt symptoms, muscle twitch rise and relaxation time constants both increased, consistent with a loss of fast-fatigable motor units. These effects became more pronounced with disease progression, consistent with the death of fast fatigue-resistant motor units and superior survival of slow motor units. From these measurements we constructed a physiological metric that reflects the changing distributions of measured motor unit time constants and effectively diagnoses mice before symptomatic onset and tracks disease state. These results indicate that SHG microendoscopy provides a means for developing a quantitative, physiologic characterization of ALS progression.},

Combining a soma-targeted ASAP3 variant and ULoVE, we show single-trial tracking of spikes and subthreshold events for minutes in deep locations, with subcellular resolution and with repeated sampling over days. In the visual cortex, we use soma-targeted ASAP3 to illustrate cell-type-dependent subthreshold modulation by locomotion.

Imageable under the modest illumination intensities required by bright green probes (<50 mW mm ), VARNAM is readily usable in vivo. VARNAM can be combined with blue-shifted optical tools to enable cell-type-specific all-optical electrophysiology and dual-color spike imaging in acute brain slices and live Drosophila. With enhanced sensitivity to subthreshold voltages, VARNAM resolves postsynaptic potentials in slices and cortical and hippocampal rhythms in freely behaving mice. Together, VARNAM lends a new hue to the optical toolbox, opening the door to high-speed in vivo multispectral functional imaging.},

By longitudinally imaging neural calcium dynamics in freely moving mice across different environments, we identified opponent changes in activity levels of two major, nonoverlapping populations of basal amygdala principal neurons. This population signature does not report global anxiety but predicts switches between exploratory and nonexploratory, defensive states. Moreover, the amygdala separately processes external stimuli and internal states and broadcasts state information via several output pathways to larger brain networks. Our findings extend the concept of thalamocortical "brain-state" coding to include affective and exploratory states and provide an entry point into the state dependency of brain function and behavior in defined circuits.},

Here, by directly comparing premotor L5 and GrC activity during a forelimb movement task using dual-site two-photon Ca  imaging, we found that in expert mice, L5 and GrC dynamics were highly similar. L5 cells and GrCs shared a common set of task-encoding activity patterns, possessed similar diversity of responses, and exhibited high correlations comparable to local correlations among L5 cells. Chronic imaging revealed that these dynamics co-emerged in cortex and cerebellum over learning: as behavioral performance improved, initially dissimilar L5 cells and GrCs converged onto a shared, low-dimensional, task-encoding set of neural activity patterns. Thus, a key function of cortico-cerebellar communication is the propagation of shared dynamics that emerge during learning.},

Each environment evokes characteristic patterns of ensemble neural plasticity, but with each encounter, the set of activated cells gradually evolves. After repeated exposures, the plasticity patterns evoked by an individual environment progressively stabilize. Compared with young adults, plasticity patterns in aged mice are less specific to individual environments and less stable across repeat experiences. Long-term consolidation of hippocampal plasticity patterns may support long-term memory formation, whereas weaker consolidation in aged subjects might reflect declining memory function.},

By means of time-lapse in vivo calcium imaging and neural activity manipulation in freely behaving mice encountering noxious stimuli, we identified a distinct neural ensemble in the basolateral amygdala that encodes the negative affective valence of pain. Silencing this nociceptive ensemble alleviated pain affective-motivational behaviors without altering the detection of noxious stimuli, withdrawal reflexes, anxiety, or reward. Following peripheral nerve injury, innocuous stimuli activated this nociceptive ensemble to drive dysfunctional perceptual changes associated with neuropathic pain, including pain aversion to light touch (allodynia). These results identify the amygdalar representations of noxious stimuli that are functionally required for the negative affective qualities of acute and chronic pain perception.},

While recent experimental advances enable large-scale and long-term neural recordings with high temporal fidelity, it remains a formidable challenge to extract unbiased and interpretable descriptions of how rapid single-trial circuit dynamics change slowly over many trials to mediate learning. We demonstrate a simple tensor component analysis (TCA) can meet this challenge by extracting three interconnected, low-dimensional descriptions of neural data: neuron factors, reflecting cell assemblies; temporal factors, reflecting rapid circuit dynamics mediating perceptions, thoughts, and actions within each trial; and trial factors, describing both long-term learning and trial-to-trial changes in cognitive state. We demonstrate the broad applicability of TCA by revealing insights into diverse datasets derived from artificial neural networks, large-scale calcium imaging of rodent prefrontal cortex during maze navigation, and multielectrode recordings of macaque motor cortex during brain machine interface learning.},

The opposite imbalance might underlie hyperkinetic abnormalities, such as dyskinesia caused by treatment of Parkinson's disease with the dopamine precursor L-DOPA. Here we monitored thousands of SPNs in behaving mice, before and after dopamine depletion and during L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. Normally, intermingled clusters of dSPNs and iSPNs coactivated before movement. Dopamine depletion unbalanced SPN activity rates and disrupted the movement-encoding iSPN clusters. Matching their clinical efficacy, L-DOPA or agonism of the D  dopamine receptor reversed these abnormalities more effectively than agonism of the D  dopamine receptor. The opposite pathophysiology arose in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, during which iSPNs showed hypoactivity and dSPNs showed unclustered hyperactivity. Therefore, both the spatiotemporal profiles and rates of SPN activity appear crucial to striatal function, and next-generation treatments for basal ganglia disorders should target both facets of striatal activity.},

We used a miniature microscope to image the Ca  dynamics of large neural ensembles in awake behaving mice and tracked the responses of MeA neurons over several months. These recordings revealed spatially intermingled subsets of MeA neurons with distinct temporal dynamics. The encoding of social information in the MeA differed between males and females and relied on information from both individual cells and neuronal populations. By performing long-term Ca  imaging across different social contexts, we found that sexual experience triggers lasting and sex-specific changes in MeA activity, which, in males, involve signaling by oxytocin. These findings reveal basic principles underlying the brain's representation of social information and its modulation by intrinsic and extrinsic factors.},

Whether such behaviours are mediated by anatomically distinct and/or genetically specified neural pathways remains unknown. Here we report that neural representations within the mouse hypothalamus, that underlie innate social behaviours, are shaped by social experience. Oestrogen receptor 1-expressing (Esr1 ) neurons in the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) control mating and fighting in rodents. We used microendoscopy to image Esr1  neuronal activity in the VMHvl of male mice engaged in these social behaviours. In sexually and socially experienced adult males, divergent and characteristic neural ensembles represented male versus female conspecifics. However, in inexperienced adult males, male and female intruders activated overlapping neuronal populations. Sex-specific neuronal ensembles gradually separated as the mice acquired social and sexual experience. In mice permitted to investigate but not to mount or attack conspecifics, ensemble divergence did not occur. However, 30 minutes of sexual experience with a female was sufficient to promote the separation of male and female ensembles and to induce an attack response 24 h later. These observations uncover an unexpected social experience-dependent component to the formation of hypothalamic neural assemblies controlling innate social behaviours. More generally, they reveal plasticity and dynamic coding in an evolutionarily ancient deep subcortical structure that is traditionally viewed as a 'hard-wired' system.},

Classical theories posit that a large, diverse population of granule cells allows for highly detailed representations of sensorimotor context, enabling downstream Purkinje cells to sense fine contextual changes. Although evidence suggests a role for the cerebellum in cognition, granule cells are known to encode only sensory and motor context. Here, using two-photon calcium imaging in behaving mice, we show that granule cells convey information about the expectation of reward. Mice initiated voluntary forelimb movements for delayed sugar-water reward. Some granule cells responded preferentially to reward or reward omission, whereas others selectively encoded reward anticipation. Reward responses were not restricted to forelimb movement, as a Pavlovian task evoked similar responses. Compared to predictable rewards, unexpected rewards elicited markedly different granule cell activity despite identical stimuli and licking responses. In both tasks, reward signals were widespread throughout multiple cerebellar lobules. Tracking the same granule cells over several days of learning revealed that cells with reward-anticipating responses emerged from those that responded at the start of learning to reward delivery, whereas reward-omission responses grew stronger as learning progressed. The discovery of predictive, non-sensorimotor encoding in granule cells is a major departure from the current understanding of these neurons and markedly enriches the contextual information available to postsynaptic Purkinje cells, with important implications for cognitive processing in the cerebellum.},

Two-photon microscopy revealed dendritic morphologies throughout neocortex, allowed time-lapse imaging of individual cells, and yielded estimates of >1 million accessible neurons per mouse by serial tiling. This approach supports a variety of optical techniques and enables studies of cells across >30 neocortical areas in behaving mice.},

To empower mechanistic studies, we created an optical technique, TEMPO, that records the aggregate trans-membrane voltage dynamics of genetically specified neurons in freely behaving mice. TEMPO has >10-fold greater sensitivity than prior fiber-optic techniques and attains the noise minimum set by quantum mechanical photon shot noise. After validating TEMPO's capacity to track established oscillations in the delta, theta, and gamma frequency bands, we compared the D1- and D2-dopamine-receptor-expressing striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which are interspersed and electrically indistinguishable. Unexpectedly, MSN population dynamics exhibited two distinct coherent states that were commonly indiscernible in electrical recordings and involved synchronized hyperpolarizations across both MSN subtypes. Overall, TEMPO allows the deconstruction of normal and pathologic neurophysiological states into trans-membrane voltage activity patterns of specific cell types.},

Memory contextualization is fundamental for the selection of appropriate behavioral reactions needed for survival, yet the underlying neuronal circuits are poorly understood. By combining trans-synaptic viral tracing and optogenetic manipulation, we found that the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and the amygdala, two key brain structures encoding context and emotional experiences, interact via multiple parallel pathways. A projection from the vHC to the basal amygdala mediates fear behavior elicited by a conditioned context, whereas a parallel projection from a distinct subset of vHC neurons onto midbrain-projecting neurons in the central amygdala is necessary for context-dependent retrieval of cued fear memories. Our findings demonstrate that two fundamentally distinct roles of context in fear memory retrieval are processed by distinct vHC output pathways, thereby allowing for the formation of robust contextual fear memories while preserving context-dependent behavioral flexibility.},

Using a miniature fluorescence microscope, we tracked the Ca  dynamics of ensembles of amygdalar neurons during fear learning and extinction over 6 days in behaving mice. Fear conditioning induced both up- and down-regulation of individual cells' CS-evoked responses. This bi-directional plasticity mainly occurred after conditioning, and reshaped the neural ensemble representation of the CS to become more similar to the US representation. During extinction training with repetitive CS presentations, the CS representation became more distinctive without reverting to its original form. Throughout the experiments, the strength of the ensemble-encoded CS-US association predicted the level of behavioural conditioning in each mouse. These findings support a supervised learning model in which activation of the US representation guides the transformation of the CS representation.},

Fluorescence Ca(2+)-imaging techniques can monitor hundreds of neurons in behaving mice, opening exciting avenues for studies of learning and memory at the network level. Genetically encoded Ca(2+) indicators allow neurons to be targeted by genetic type or connectivity. Chronic animal preparations permit repeated imaging of neural Ca(2+) dynamics over multiple weeks. Together, these capabilities should enable unprecedented analyses of how ensemble neural codes evolve throughout memory processing and provide new insights into how memories are organized in the brain.},

Despite their importance, in vivo sarcomere lengths remain unknown for many human muscles. Second harmonic generation (SHG) microendoscopy is a minimally invasive technique for imaging sarcomeres in vivo and measuring their lengths. In this study, we used SHG microendoscopy to visualize sarcomeres of the human vastus lateralis, a large knee extensor muscle important for mobility, to examine how sarcomere lengths change with knee flexion and thus affect the muscle׳s force-generating capacity. We acquired in vivo sarcomere images of several muscle fibers of the resting vastus lateralis in six healthy individuals. Mean sarcomere lengths increased (p=0.031) from 2.84±0.16μm at 50° of knee flexion to 3.17±0.13μm at 110° of knee flexion. The standard deviation of sarcomere lengths among different fibers within a muscle was 0.21±0.09μm. Our results suggest that the sarcomeres of the resting vastus lateralis at 50° of knee flexion are near optimal length. At a knee flexion angle of 110° the resting sarcomeres of vastus lateralis are longer than optimal length. These results show a smaller sarcomere length change and greater conservation of force-generating capacity with knee flexion than estimated in previous studies.},

  abstract     = {Prolonged exposure to abnormally high calcium concentrations is thought to be a core mechanism underlying hippocampal damage in epileptic patients; however, no prior study has characterized calcium activity during seizures in the live, intact hippocampus. We have directly investigated this possibility by combining whole-brain electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements with microendoscopic calcium imaging of pyramidal cells in the CA1 hippocampal region of freely behaving mice treated with the pro-convulsant kainic acid (KA). We observed that KA administration led to systematic patterns of epileptiform calcium activity: a series of large-scale, intensifying flashes of increased calcium fluorescence concurrent with a cluster of low-amplitude EEG waveforms. This was accompanied by a steady increase in cellular calcium levels (>5 fold increase relative to the baseline), followed by an intense spreading calcium wave characterized by a 218% increase in global mean intensity of calcium fluorescence (n = 8, range [114-349%], p < 10(-4); t-test). The wave had no consistent EEG phenotype and occurred before the onset of motor convulsions. Similar changes in calcium activity were also observed in animals treated with 2 different proconvulsant agents, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), suggesting the measured changes in calcium dynamics are a signature of seizure activity rather than a KA-specific pathology. Additionally, despite reducing the behavioral severity of KA-induced seizures, the anticonvulsant drug valproate (VA, 300 mg/kg) did not modify the observed abnormalities in calcium dynamics. These results confirm the presence of pathological calcium activity preceding convulsive motor seizures and support calcium as a candidate signaling molecule in a pathway connecting seizures to subsequent cellular damage. Integrating in vivo calcium imaging with traditional assessment of seizures could potentially increase translatability of pharmacological intervention, leading to novel drug screening paradigms and therapeutics designed to target and abolish abnormal patterns of both electrical and calcium excitation.},

Here, we show that Ocean cells, excitatory stellate neurons in the medial EC layer II projecting into DG and CA3, rapidly form a distinct representation of a novel context and drive context-specific activation of downstream CA3 cells as well as context-specific fear memory. In contrast, Island cells, excitatory pyramidal neurons in the medial EC layer II projecting into CA1, are indifferent to context-specific encoding or memory. On the other hand, Ocean cells are dispensable for temporal association learning, for which Island cells are crucial. Together, the two excitatory medial EC layer II inputs to the hippocampus have complementary roles in episodic memory.},

We created a wearable microscope equipped with a microendoscope for minimally invasive observation of sarcomere lengths and contractile dynamics in any major skeletal muscle. By electrically stimulating twitches via the microendoscope and visualizing the sarcomere displacements, we monitored single motor unit contractions in soleus and vastus lateralis muscles of healthy individuals. Control experiments verified that these evoked twitches involved neuromuscular transmission and faithfully reported muscle force generation. In post-stroke patients with spasticity of the biceps brachii, we found involuntary microscopic contractions and sarcomere length abnormalities.

Previous GEVIs had insufficient signaling speed and dynamic range to resolve action potentials in live animals. We coupled fast voltage-sensing domains from a rhodopsin protein to bright fluorophores through resonance energy transfer. The resulting GEVIs are sufficiently bright and fast to report neuronal action potentials and membrane voltage dynamics in awake mice and flies, resolving fast spike trains with 0.2-millisecond timing precision at spike detection error rates orders of magnitude better than previous GEVIs. In vivo imaging revealed sensory-evoked responses, including somatic spiking, dendritic dynamics, and intracellular voltage propagation. These results empower in vivo optical studies of neuronal electrophysiology and coding and motivate further advancements in high-speed microscopy.},

Medial entorhinal cortex layer II contains pyramidal island and stellate ocean cells. Here, we performed cell type-specific Ca(2+) imaging in freely exploring mice using cellular markers and a miniature head-mounted fluorescence microscope. We found that both oceans and islands contain grid cells in similar proportions, but island cell activity, including activity in a proportion of grid cells, is significantly more speed modulated than ocean cell activity. We speculate that this differential property reflects island cells' and ocean cells' contribution to different downstream functions: island cells may contribute more to spatial path integration, whereas ocean cells may facilitate contextual representation in downstream circuits.},

  abstract        = {The mammalian hippocampus is crucial for episodic memory formation and transiently retains information for about 3-4 weeks in adult mice and longer in humans. Although neuroscientists widely believe that neural synapses are elemental sites of information storage, there has been no direct evidence that hippocampal synapses persist for time intervals commensurate with the duration of hippocampal-dependent memory. Here we tested the prediction that the lifetimes of hippocampal synapses match the longevity of hippocampal memory. By using time-lapse two-photon microendoscopy in the CA1 hippocampal area of live mice, we monitored the turnover dynamics of the pyramidal neurons' basal dendritic spines, postsynaptic structures whose turnover dynamics are thought to reflect those of excitatory synaptic connections. Strikingly, CA1 spine turnover dynamics differed sharply from those seen previously in the neocortex. Mathematical modelling revealed that the data best matched kinetic models with a single population of spines with a mean lifetime of approximately 1-2 weeks. This implies ∼100% turnover in ∼2-3 times this interval, a near full erasure of the synaptic connectivity pattern. Although N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade stabilizes spines in the neocortex, in CA1 it transiently increased the rate of spine loss and thus lowered spine density. These results reveal that adult neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons have divergent patterns of spine regulation and quantitatively support the idea that the transience of hippocampal-dependent memory directly reflects the turnover dynamics of hippocampal synapses.},

We discuss recent progress and future directions for imaging in behaving mammals from a systems engineering perspective, which seeks holistic consideration of fluorescent indicators, optical instrumentation, and computational analyses. Today, genetically encoded indicators of neural Ca(2+) dynamics are widely used, and those of trans-membrane voltage are rapidly improving. Two complementary imaging paradigms involve conventional microscopes for studying head-restrained animals and head-mounted miniature microscopes for imaging in freely behaving animals. Overall, the field has attained sufficient sophistication that increased cooperation between those designing new indicators, light sources, microscopes, and computational analyses would greatly benefit future progress.},

To understand how TRCs transmit information to higher neural centres, we examined the tuning properties of large ensembles of neurons in the first neural station of the gustatory system. Here, we generated and characterized a collection of transgenic mice expressing a genetically encoded calcium indicator in central and peripheral neurons, and used a gradient refractive index microendoscope combined with high-resolution two-photon microscopy to image taste responses from ganglion neurons buried deep at the base of the brain. Our results reveal fine selectivity in the taste preference of ganglion neurons; demonstrate a strong match between TRCs in the tongue and the principal neural afferents relaying taste information to the brain; and expose the highly specific transfer of taste information between taste cells and the central nervous system.},

Here we demonstrate a new approach to elucidate drug action on large-scale neuronal activity by tracking somatic calcium dynamics in hundreds of CA1 hippocampal neurons of pharmacologically manipulated behaving mice. We used an adeno-associated viral vector to express the calcium sensor GCaMP3 in CA1 pyramidal cells under control of the CaMKII promoter and a miniaturized microscope to observe cellular dynamics. We visualized these dynamics with and without a systemic administration of Zolpidem, a GABAA agonist that is the most commonly prescribed drug for the treatment of insomnia in the United States. Despite growing concerns about the potential adverse effects of Zolpidem on memory and cognition, it remained unclear whether Zolpidem alters neuronal activity in the hippocampus, a brain area critical for cognition and memory. Zolpidem, when delivered at a dose known to induce and prolong sleep, strongly suppressed CA1 calcium signaling. The rate of calcium transients after Zolpidem administration was significantly lower compared to vehicle treatment. To factor out the contribution of changes in locomotor or physiological conditions following Zolpidem treatment, we compared the cellular activity across comparable epochs matched by locomotor and physiological assessments. This analysis revealed significantly depressive effects of Zolpidem regardless of the animal's state. Individual hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells differed in their responses to Zolpidem with the majority (∼ 65%) significantly decreasing the rate of calcium transients, and a small subset (3%) showing an unexpected and significant increase. By linking molecular mechanisms with the dynamics of neural circuitry and behavioral states, this approach has the potential to contribute substantially to the development of new therapeutics for the treatment of CNS disorders.},

These FRET-opsin sensors significantly improve upon the spike detection fidelity offered by the genetically encoded voltage sensor, Arclight, while offering faster kinetics and higher brightness. Using FRET-opsin sensors we imaged neural spiking and sub-threshold membrane voltage dynamics in cultured neurons and in pyramidal cells within neocortical tissue slices. In live mice, rates and optical waveforms of cerebellar Purkinje neurons' dendritic voltage transients matched expectations for these cells' dendritic spikes.},

Here we introduce a spatially precise (<1-µm edge precision), high-speed (<1 s), largely automated, and economical protocol for microsurgical preparation of live animals for optical imaging. Using a 193-nm pulsed excimer laser and the fruit fly as a model, we created observation windows (12- to 350-µm diameters) in the exoskeleton. Through these windows we used two-photon microscopy to image odor-evoked Ca(2+) signaling in projection neuron dendrites of the antennal lobe and Kenyon cells of the mushroom body. The impact of a laser-cut window on fly health appears to be substantially less than that of conventional manual dissection, for our imaging durations of up to 18 h were ∼5-20 times longer than prior in vivo microscopy studies of hand-dissected flies. This improvement will facilitate studies of numerous questions in neuroscience, such as those regarding neuronal plasticity or learning and memory. As a control, we used phototaxis as an exemplary complex behavior in flies and found that laser microsurgery is sufficiently gentle to leave it intact. To demonstrate that our techniques are applicable to other species, we created microsurgical openings in nematodes, ants, and the mouse cranium. In conjunction with emerging robotic methods for handling and mounting flies or other small organisms, our rapid, precisely controllable, and highly repeatable microsurgical techniques should enable automated, high-throughput preparation of live animals for optical experimentation.},

  abstract        = {Many forms of learning require temporally ordered stimuli. In Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning, a conditioned stimulus (CS) must precede the unconditioned stimulus (US) by at least about 100 ms for learning to occur. Conditioned responses are learned and generated by the cerebellum. Recordings from the cerebellar cortex during conditioning have revealed CS-triggered pauses in the firing of Purkinje cells that likely drive the conditioned blinks. The predominant view of the learning mechanism in conditioning is that long-term depression (LTD) at parallel fiber (PF)-Purkinje cell synapses underlies the Purkinje cell pauses. This raises a serious conceptual challenge because LTD is most effectively induced at short CS-US intervals, which do not support acquisition of eyeblinks. To resolve this discrepancy, we recorded Purkinje cells during conditioning with short or long CS-US intervals. Decerebrated ferrets trained with CS-US intervals ≥150 ms reliably developed Purkinje cell pauses, but training with an interval of 50 ms unexpectedly induced increases in CS-evoked spiking. This bidirectional modulation of Purkinje cell activity offers a basis for the requirement of a minimum CS-US interval for conditioning, but we argue that it cannot be fully explained by LTD, even when previous in vitro studies of stimulus-timing-dependent LTD are taken into account.},

Optical sensors of transmembrane voltage would enhance studies of neural activity in contexts ranging from individual neurons cultured in vitro to neuronal populations in awake-behaving animals. Recent progress has identified Archaerhodopsin (Arch) based sensors as a promising, genetically encoded class of fluorescent voltage indicators that can report single action potentials. Wild-type Arch exhibits sub-millisecond fluorescence responses to trans-membrane voltage, but its light-activated proton pump also responds to the imaging illumination. An Arch mutant (Arch-D95N) exhibits no photocurrent, but has a slower, ~40 ms response to voltage transients. Here we present Arch-derived voltage sensors with trafficking signals that enhance their localization to the neural membrane. We also describe Arch mutant sensors (Arch-EEN and -EEQ) that exhibit faster kinetics and greater fluorescence dynamic range than Arch-D95N, and no photocurrent at the illumination intensities normally used for imaging. We benchmarked these voltage sensors regarding their spike detection fidelity by using a signal detection theoretic framework that takes into account the experimentally measured photon shot noise and optical waveforms for single action potentials. This analysis revealed that by combining the sequence mutations and enhanced trafficking sequences, the new sensors improved the fidelity of spike detection by nearly three-fold in comparison to Arch-D95N.},

While peripheral neurons often implement efficient encoding by exploiting natural stimulus statistics, downstream neurons are specialized to extract behaviorally relevant features. How do these specializations arise? We use two-photon imaging in Drosophila to characterize a first-order interneuron, L2, that provides input to a pathway specialized for detecting moving dark edges. GABAergic interactions, mediated in part presynaptically, create an antagonistic and anisotropic center-surround receptive field. This receptive field is spatiotemporally coupled, applying differential temporal processing to large and small dark objects, achieving significant specialization. GABAergic circuits also mediate OFF responses and balance these with responses to ON stimuli. Remarkably, the functional properties of L2 are strikingly similar to those of bipolar cells, yet emerge through different molecular and circuit mechanisms. Thus, evolution appears to have converged on a common strategy for processing visual information at the first synapse.},

We also measured the variability in sarcomere lengths within single fibers. Average sarcomere lengths in 45° extension were 2.93±0.29 μm (±SD) and increased to 3.58±0.19 μm in 45° flexion. Within single fibers the standard deviation of sarcomere lengths in series was 0.20 μm. Microendoscopy can be used to measure sarcomere lengths at different body postures.

  abstract        = {Correlated electrical activity in neurons is a prominent characteristic of cortical microcircuits. Despite a growing amount of evidence concerning both spike-count and subthreshold membrane potential pairwise correlations, little is known about how different types of cortical neurons convert correlated inputs into correlated outputs. We studied pyramidal neurons and two classes of GABAergic interneurons of layer 5 in neocortical brain slices obtained from rats of both sexes, and we stimulated them with biophysically realistic correlated inputs, generated using dynamic clamp. We found that the physiological differences between cell types manifested unique features in their capacity to transfer correlated inputs. We used linear response theory and computational modeling to gain clear insights into how cellular properties determine both the gain and timescale of correlation transfer, thus tying single-cell features with network interactions. Our results provide further ground for the functionally distinct roles played by various types of neuronal cells in the cortical microcircuit.  No matter how we probe the brain, we find correlated neuronal activity over a variety of spatial and temporal scales. For the cerebral cortex, significant evidence has accumulated on trial-to-trial covariability in synaptic inputs activation, subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations, and output spike trains. Although we do not yet fully understand their origin and whether they are detrimental or beneficial for information processing, we believe that clarifying how correlations emerge is pivotal for understanding large-scale neuronal network dynamics and computation. Here, we report quantitative differences between excitatory and inhibitory cells, as they relay input correlations into output correlations. We explain this heterogeneity by simple biophysical models and provide the most experimentally validated test of a theory for the emergence of correlations.},

Theoretical studies of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) have focused on either just pairs of neurons or large-scale simulations. A simple analytic account for how fast spike time correlations affect both microscopic and macroscopic network structure is lacking. We develop a low-dimensional mean field theory for STDP in recurrent networks and show the emergence of assemblies of strongly coupled neurons with shared stimulus preferences. After training, this connectivity is actively reinforced by spike train correlations during the spontaneous dynamics. Furthermore, the stimulus coding by cell assemblies is actively maintained by these internally generated spiking correlations, suggesting a new role for noise correlations in neural coding. Assembly formation has often been associated with firing rate-based plasticity schemes; our theory provides an alternative and complementary framework, where fine temporal correlations and STDP form and actively maintain learned structure in cortical networks.},

We review here recent studies that have begun to relate neuronal recordings and network models based on the multi-dimensional structure of neuronal population activity, as identified using dimensionality reduction. This approach has been used to study working memory, decision making, motor control, and more.

A pervasive yet puzzling feature of cortical circuits is that despite their complex wiring, population-wide shared spiking variability is low dimensional. Previous model cortical networks cannot explain this global variability, and rather assume it is from external sources. We show that if the spatial and temporal scales of inhibitory coupling match known physiology, networks of model spiking neurons internally generate low-dimensional shared variability that captures population activity recorded in vivo. Shifting spatial attention into the receptive field of visual neurons has been shown to differentially modulate shared variability within and between brain areas. A top-down modulation of inhibitory neurons in our network provides a parsimonious mechanism for this attentional modulation. Our work provides a critical link between observed cortical circuit structure and realistic shared neuronal variability and its modulation.},

Fast time scales are determined by the kinetics of synaptic conductances and ionic channels; however, the mechanics of slow time scales are more complicated. In this opinion article we review two distinct network-based mechanisms that impart slow time scales in recurrently coupled neuronal networks. The first is in strongly coupled networks where the time scale of the internally generated fluctuations diverges at the transition between stable and chaotic firing rate activity. The second is in networks with finitely many members where noise-induced transitions between metastable states appear as a slow time scale in the ongoing network firing activity. We discuss these mechanisms with an emphasis on their similarities and differences.},

To date, these methods have treated each neuron equally, without taking into account whether neurons are excitatory or inhibitory. We studied population activity structure as a function of neuron type by applying factor analysis to spontaneous activity from spiking networks with balanced excitation and inhibition. Throughout the study, we characterized population activity structure by measuring its dimensionality and the percentage of overall activity variance that is shared among neurons. First, by sampling only excitatory or only inhibitory neurons, we found that the activity structures of these two populations in balanced networks are measurably different. We also found that the population activity structure is dependent on the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurons sampled. Finally we classified neurons from extracellular recordings in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized macaques as putative excitatory or inhibitory using waveform classification, and found similarities with the neuron type-specific population activity structure of a balanced network with excitatory clustering. These results imply that knowledge of neuron type is important, and allows for stronger statistical tests, when interpreting population activity structure.},

For the most part, low pass membrane integration and spike threshold dynamics have been the primary features assumed in the transfer from synaptic input to output spiking. Phasic neurons are a common, but understudied, neuron class that are characterized by a subthreshold negative feedback that suppresses spike train responses to low frequency signals. Past work has shown that when a low frequency signal is accompanied by moderate intensity broadband noise, phasic neurons spike trains are well locked to the signal. We extend these results with a simple, reduced model of phasic activity that demonstrates that a non-Markovian spike train structure caused by the negative feedback produces a noise-enhanced coding. Further, this enhancement is sensitive to the timescales, as opposed to the intensity, of a driving signal. Reduced hazard function models show that noise-enhanced phasic codes are both novel and separate from classical stochastic resonance reported in non-phasic neurons. The general features of our theory suggest that noise-enhanced codes in excitable systems with subthreshold negative feedback are a particularly rich framework to study.},

We provide a novel analysis of population recordings in rhesus primate visual area V4 showing that a single biophysical mechanism may underlie these diverse neural correlates of attention. We explore model cortical networks where top-down mediated increases in excitability, distributed across excitatory and inhibitory targets, capture the key neuronal correlates of attention. Our models predict that top-down signals primarily affect inhibitory neurons, whereas excitatory neurons are more sensitive to stimulus specific bottom-up inputs. Accounting for trial variability in models of state dependent modulation of neuronal activity is a critical step in building a mechanistic theory of neuronal cognition.},

Extending the theory of networks with balanced excitation and inhibition, we find that spatially localized lateral projections promote weakly correlated spiking, but broader lateral projections produce a distinctive spatial correlation structure: nearby neuron pairs are positively correlated, pairs at intermediate distances are negatively correlated and distant pairs are weakly correlated. This non-monotonic dependence of correlation on distance is revealed in a new analysis of recordings from superficial layers of macaque primary visual cortex. Our findings show that incorporating distance-dependent connectivity improves the extent to which balanced network theory can explain correlated neural variability.},

It is unclear, however, how the results obtained from dimensionality reduction generalize to recordings with larger numbers of neurons and trials or how these results relate to the underlying network structure. We address these questions by applying factor analysis to recordings in the visual cortex of non-human primates and to spiking network models that self-generate irregular activity through a balance of excitation and inhibition. We compared the scaling trends of two key outputs of dimensionality reduction-shared dimensionality and percent shared variance-with neuron and trial count. We found that the scaling properties of networks with non-clustered and clustered connectivity differed, and that the in vivo recordings were more consistent with the clustered network. Furthermore, recordings from tens of neurons were sufficient to identify the dominant modes of shared variability that generalize to larger portions of the network. These findings can help guide the interpretation of dimensionality reduction outputs in regimes of limited neuron and trial sampling and help relate these outputs to the underlying network structure.},

An important feature of population activity is the trial-to-trial correlated fluctuation of spike train outputs from recorded neuron pairs. Similar to the firing rate of single neurons, correlated activity can be modulated by a number of factors, from changes in arousal and attentional state to learning and task engagement. However, the physiological mechanisms that underlie these changes are not fully understood. We review recent theoretical results that identify three separate mechanisms that modulate spike train correlations: changes in input correlations, internal fluctuations and the transfer function of single neurons. We first examine these mechanisms in feedforward pathways and then show how the same approach can explain the modulation of correlations in recurrent networks. Such mechanistic constraints on the modulation of population activity will be important in statistical analyses of high-dimensional neural data.},

We study the dynamics of recurrent excitatory-inhibitory model cortical networks with parvalbumin (PV)-, somatostatin (SOM)-, and vasointestinal peptide-expressing (VIP) interneurons, with connectivity properties motivated by experimental recordings from mouse primary visual cortex. Our theory describes conditions under which the activity of such networks is stable and how perturbations of distinct neuronal subtypes recruit changes in activity through recurrent synaptic projections. We apply these conclusions to study the roles of each interneuron subtype in disinhibition, surround suppression, and subtractive or divisive modulation of orientation tuning curves. Our calculations and simulations determine the architectural and stimulus tuning conditions under which cortical activity consistent with experiment is possible. They also lead to novel predictions concerning connectivity and network dynamics that can be tested via optogenetic manipulations. Our work demonstrates that recurrent inhibitory dynamics must be taken into account to fully understand many properties of cortical dynamics observed in experiments.},

  abstract        = {The synaptic connectivity of cortical networks features an overrepresentation of certain wiring motifs compared to simple random-network models. This structure is shaped, in part, by synaptic plasticity that promotes or suppresses connections between neurons depending on their joint spiking activity. Frequently, theoretical studies focus on how feedforward inputs drive plasticity to create this network structure. We study the complementary scenario of self-organized structure in a recurrent network, with spike timing-dependent plasticity driven by spontaneous dynamics. We develop a self-consistent theory for the evolution of network structure by combining fast spiking covariance with a slow evolution of synaptic weights. Through a finite-size expansion of network dynamics we obtain a low-dimensional set of nonlinear differential equations for the evolution of two-synapse connectivity motifs. With this theory in hand, we explore how the form of the plasticity rule drives the evolution of microcircuits in cortical networks. When potentiation and depression are in approximate balance, synaptic dynamics depend on weighted divergent, convergent, and chain motifs. For additive, Hebbian STDP these motif interactions create instabilities in synaptic dynamics that either promote or suppress the initial network structure. Our work provides a consistent theoretical framework for studying how spiking activity in recurrent networks interacts with synaptic plasticity to determine network structure.},

However, it is unclear how these patterns are maintained in the face of the high spike time variability associated with cortex. Here we demonstrate, using a large-scale cortical network model, that realistic synaptic plasticity rules coupled with homeostatic mechanisms lead to the formation of neuronal assemblies that reflect previously experienced stimuli. Further, reverberation of past evoked states in spontaneous spiking activity stabilizes, rather than erases, this learned architecture. Spontaneous and evoked spiking activity contains a signature of learned assembly structures, leading to testable predictions about the effect of recent sensory experience on spike train statistics. Our work outlines requirements for synaptic plasticity rules capable of modifying spontaneous dynamics and shows that this modification is beneficial for stability of learned network architectures.},

  abstract        = {Low-threshold M currents are mediated by the Kv7 family of potassium channels. Kv7 channels are important regulators of spiking activity, having a direct influence on the firing rate, spike time variability, and filter properties of neurons. How Kv7 channels affect the joint spiking activity of populations of neurons is an important and open area of study. Using a combination of computational simulations and analytic calculations, we show that the activation of Kv7 conductances reduces the covariability between spike trains of pairs of neurons driven by common inputs. This reduction is beyond that explained by the lowering of firing rates and involves an active cancellation of common fluctuations in the membrane potentials of the cell pair. Our theory shows that the excess covariance reduction is due to a Kv7-induced shift from low-pass to band-pass filtering of the single neuron spike train response. Dysfunction of Kv7 conductances is related to a number of neurological diseases characterized by both elevated firing rates and increased network-wide correlations. We show how changes in the activation or strength of Kv7 conductances give rise to excess correlations that cannot be compensated for by synaptic scaling or homeostatic modulation of passive membrane properties. In contrast, modulation of Kv7 activation parameters consistent with pharmacological treatments for certain hyperactivity disorders can restore normal firing rates and spiking correlations. Our results provide key insights into how regulation of a ubiquitous potassium channel class can control the coordination of population spiking activity.},

This variability is large in the spontaneous state and is reduced when cortex is driven by a stimulus or task. Models of recurrent cortical networks with unstructured, yet balanced, excitation and inhibition generate variability consistent with evoked conditions. However, these models produce spike trains which lack the long timescale fluctuations and large variability exhibited during spontaneous cortical dynamics. We propose that global network architectures which support a large number of stable states (attractor networks) allow balanced networks to capture key features of neural variability in both spontaneous and evoked conditions. We illustrate this using balanced spiking networks with clustered assembly, feedforward chain, and ring structures. By assuming that global network structure is related to stimulus preference, we show that signal correlations are related to the magnitude of correlations in the spontaneous state. Finally, we contrast the impact of stimulation on the trial-to-trial variability in attractor networks with that of strongly coupled spiking networks with chaotic firing rate instabilities, recently investigated by Ostojic (2014). We find that only attractor networks replicate an experimentally observed stimulus-induced quenching of trial-to-trial variability. In total, the comparison of the trial-variable dynamics of single neurons or neuron pairs during spontaneous and evoked activity can be a window into the global structure of balanced cortical networks.},

DBS increases the excitation of STN efferents yet decouples STN spiking patterns from the spiking patterns of STN synaptic targets. We propose that this apparent paradox is resolved by recent studies showing an increased rate of axonal and synaptic failures in STN projections during DBS. To investigate this hypothesis, we combine in vitro and in vivo recordings to derive a computational model of axonal and synaptic failure during DBS. Our model shows that these failures induce a short term depression that suppresses the synaptic transfer of firing rate oscillations, synchrony and rate-coded information from STN to its synaptic targets. In particular, our computational model reproduces the widely reported suppression of parkinsonian β oscillations and synchrony during DBS. Our results support the idea that short term depression is a therapeutic mechanism of STN DBS that works as a functional lesion by decoupling the somatic spiking patterns of STN neurons from spiking activity in basal ganglia output nuclei.},

Network models with local excitation and broad inhibition support persistent neural activity, linking network architecture and parametric working memory. Cortical neurons receive noisy input fluctuations that cause persistent activity to diffusively wander about the network, degrading memory over time. We explore how cortical architecture that supports parametric working memory affects the diffusion of persistent neural activity. Studying both a spiking network and a simplified potential well model, we show that spatially heterogeneous excitatory coupling stabilizes a discrete number of persistent states, reducing the diffusion of persistent activity over the network. However, heterogeneous coupling also coarse-grains the stimulus representation space, limiting the storage capacity of parametric working memory. The storage errors due to coarse-graining and diffusion trade off so that information transfer between the initial and recalled stimulus is optimized at a fixed network heterogeneity. For sufficiently long delay times, the optimal number of attractors is less than the number of possible stimuli, suggesting that memory networks can under-represent stimulus space to optimize performance. Our results clearly demonstrate the combined effects of network architecture and stochastic fluctuations on parametric memory storage.},

  abstract        = {Correlated neuronal activity is an important feature in many neural codes, a neural correlate of a variety of cognitive states, as well as a signature of several disease states in the nervous system. The cellular and circuit mechanics of neural correlations is a vibrant area of research. Synapses throughout the cortex exhibit a form of short-term depression where increased presynaptic firing rates deplete neurotransmitter vesicles, which transiently reduces synaptic efficacy. The release and recovery of these vesicles are inherently stochastic, and this stochasticity introduces variability into the conductance elicited by depressing synapses. The impact of spiking and subthreshold membrane dynamics on the transfer of neuronal correlations has been studied intensively, but an investigation of the impact of short-term synaptic depression and stochastic vesicle dynamics on correlation transfer is lacking. We find that short-term synaptic depression and stochastic vesicle dynamics can substantially reduce correlations, shape the timescale over which these correlations occur, and alter the dependence of spiking correlations on firing rate. Our results show that short-term depression and stochastic vesicle dynamics need to be taken into account when modeling correlations in neuronal populations.},

In contrast, the mechanisms, which generate heterogeneous neuronal behavior across a neuronal population, remain poorly understood. We addressed this problem in the dorsal cochlear nucleus, where principal neurons exist in two qualitatively distinct states: spontaneously active or not spontaneously active. Our studies reveal that distinct activity states are generated by the differential levels of a Ba(2+)-sensitive, inwardly rectifying potassium conductance (K(ir)). Variability in K(ir) maximal conductance causes variations in the resting membrane potential (RMP). Low K(ir) conductance depolarizes RMP to voltages above the threshold for activating subthreshold-persistent sodium channels (Na(p)). Once Na(p) channels are activated, the RMP becomes unstable, and spontaneous firing is triggered. Our results provide a biophysical mechanism for generating neural heterogeneity, which may play a role in the encoding of sensory information.},

  abstract     = {The responses of cortical neurons are highly variable across repeated presentations of a stimulus. Understanding this variability is critical for theories of both sensory and motor processing, since response variance affects the accuracy of neural codes. Despite this influence, the cellular and circuit mechanisms that shape the trial-to-trial variability of population responses remain poorly understood. We used a combination of experimental and computational techniques to uncover the mechanisms underlying response variability of populations of pyramidal (E) cells in layer 2/3 of rat whisker barrel cortex. Spike trains recorded from pairs of E-cells during either spontaneous activity or whisker deflected responses show similarly low levels of spiking co-variability, despite large differences in network activation between the two states. We developed network models that show how spike threshold non-linearities dilute E-cell spiking co-variability during spontaneous activity and low velocity whisker deflections. In contrast, during high velocity whisker deflections, cancelation mechanisms mediated by feedforward inhibition maintain low E-cell pairwise co-variability. Thus, the combination of these two mechanisms ensure low E-cell population variability over a wide range of whisker deflection velocities. Finally, we show how this active decorrelation of population variability leads to a drastic increase in the population information about whisker velocity. The prevalence of spiking non-linearities and feedforward inhibition in the nervous system suggests that the mechanisms for low network variability presented in our study may generalize throughout the brain.},

This plasticity affects how synapses filter presynaptic spike trains. The filtering properties of short term depression are often studied using a deterministic synapse model that predicts the mean synaptic response to a presynaptic spike train, but ignores variability introduced by the probabilistic nature of vesicle release and stochasticity in synaptic recovery time. We show that this additional variability has important consequences for the synaptic filtering of presynaptic information. In particular, a synapse model with stochastic vesicle dynamics suppresses information encoded at lower frequencies more than information encoded at higher frequencies, while a model that ignores this stochasticity transfers information encoded at any frequency equally well. This distinction between the two models persists even when large numbers of synaptic contacts are considered. Our study provides strong evidence that the stochastic nature neurotransmitter vesicle dynamics must be considered when analyzing the information flow across a synapse.},

How incoming sensory signals shape correlations of population responses remains unclear. Cross-correlations between spiking of different neurons may be particularly consequential in sparsely firing neural populations such as those found in layer 2/3 of sensory cortex. In rat whisker barrel cortex, we found that pairs of excitatory layer 2/3 neurons exhibit similarly low levels of spike count correlation during both spontaneous and sensory-evoked states. The spontaneous activity of excitatory-inhibitory neuron pairs is positively correlated, while sensory stimuli actively decorrelate joint responses. Computational modeling shows how threshold nonlinearities and local inhibition form the basis of a general decorrelating mechanism. We show that inhibitory population activity maintains low correlations in excitatory populations, especially during periods of sensory-evoked coactivation. The role of feedforward inhibition has been previously described in the context of trial-averaged phenomena. Our findings reveal a novel role for inhibition to shape correlations of neural variability and thereby prevent excessive correlations in the face of feedforward sensory-evoked activation.},

However, it is not known how these changes affect the behavior of downstream thalamic neurons. To understand how patterns of basal ganglia population activity may affect thalamic spike statistics, we study pairs of model thalamocortical (TC) relay neurons receiving correlated inhibitory input from the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), a primary output nucleus of the basal ganglia. We observe that the strength of correlations of TC neuron spike trains increases with the GPi correlation level, and bursty firing patterns such as those seen in the parkinsonian GPi allow for stronger transfer of correlations than do firing patterns found under normal conditions. We also show that the T-current in the TC neurons does not significantly affect correlation transfer, despite its pronounced effects on spiking. Oscillatory firing patterns in GPi are shown to affect the timescale at which correlations are best transferred through the system. To explain this last result, we analytically compute the spike count correlation coefficient for oscillatory cases in a reduced point process model. Our analysis indicates that the dependence of the timescale of correlation transfer is robust to different levels of input spike and rate correlations and arises due to differences in instantaneous spike correlations, even when the long timescale rhythmic modulations of neurons are identical. Overall, these results show that parkinsonian firing patterns in GPi do affect the transfer of correlations to the thalamus.},

Using a combined experimental and computational approach, we show that combined LTP and LTD of parallel fiber inputs to DCN principal cells and interneurons, respectively, broaden the time window within which synaptic inputs summate. Enhanced summation depolarizes the resting membrane potential and thus lowers the response threshold to auditory nerve inputs. Combined LTP and LTD, by preserving the variance of membrane potential fluctuations and the membrane time constant, fixes response gain and spike latency as threshold is lowered. Our data reveal a novel mechanism mediating adaptive and concomitant homeostatic regulation of distinct features of neuronal processing of sensory inputs.},

Local inhibitory networks can affect the information encoded and propagated by neurons by altering correlations between different spike trains. Correlations introduce redundancy that can reduce encoding but also facilitate propagation of activity to downstream targets. Given this trade-off, how can networks maximize both encoding and propagation efficacy? Here, we examine this problem by measuring the effects of olfactory bulb inhibition on the pairwise statistics of mitral cell spiking. We evoked spiking activity in the olfactory bulb in vitro and measured how lateral inhibition shapes correlations across timescales. We show that inhibitory circuits simultaneously increase fast correlation (i.e., synchrony increases) and decrease slow correlation (i.e., firing rates become less similar). Further, we use computational models to show the benefits of fast correlation/slow decorrelation in the context of odor coding. Olfactory bulb inhibition enhances population-level discrimination of similar inputs, while improving propagation of mitral cell activity to cortex. Our findings represent a targeted strategy by which a network can optimize the correlation structure of its output in a dynamic, activity-dependent manner. This trade-off is not specific to the olfactory system, but rather our work highlights mechanisms by which neurons can simultaneously accomplish multiple, and sometimes competing, aspects of sensory processing.},

However, in many cases the mechanisms that organize system activity oppose those that support behavioral flexibility. Thus, a balance between pattern organization and pattern flexibility is critically important for overall biological fitness. We study this balance in the foraging strategies of ant colonies exploiting food in dynamic environments. We present discrete time and space simulations of colony activity that uses a pheromone-based recruitment strategy biasing foraging towards a food source. After food relocation, the pheromone must evaporate sufficiently before foraging can shift colony attention to a new food source. The amount of food consumed within the dynamic environment depends non-monotonically on the pheromone evaporation time constant-with maximal consumption occurring at a time constant which balances trail formation and trail flexibility. A deterministic, 'mean field' model of pheromone and foragers on trails mimics our colony simulations. This reduced framework captures the essence of the flexibility-organization balance, and relates optimal pheromone evaporation to the timescale of the dynamic environment. We expect that the principles exposed in our study will generalize and motivate novel analysis across a broad range systems biology.},

  abstract        = {Fundamental properties of phasic firing neurons are usually characterized in a noise-free condition. In the absence of noise, phasic neurons exhibit Class 3 excitability, which is a lack of repetitive firing to steady current injections. For time-varying inputs, phasic neurons are band-pass filters or slope detectors, because they do not respond to inputs containing exclusively low frequencies or shallow slopes. However, we show that in noisy conditions, response properties of phasic neuron models are distinctly altered. Noise enables a phasic model to encode low-frequency inputs that are outside of the response range of the associated deterministic model. Interestingly, this seemingly stochastic-resonance (SR) like effect differs significantly from the classical SR behavior of spiking systems in both the signal-to-noise ratio and the temporal response pattern. Instead of being most sensitive to the peak of a subthreshold signal, as is typical in a classical SR system, phasic models are most sensitive to the signal's rising and falling phases where the slopes are steep. This finding is consistent with the fact that there is not an absolute input threshold in terms of amplitude; rather, a response threshold is more properly defined as a stimulus slope/frequency. We call the encoding of low-frequency signals with noise by phasic models a slope-based SR, because noise can lower or diminish the slope threshold for ramp stimuli. We demonstrate here similar behaviors in three mechanistic models with Class 3 excitability in the presence of slow-varying noise and we suggest that the slope-based SR is a fundamental behavior associated with general phasic properties rather than with a particular biological mechanism.},

  abstract        = {The magnitude of correlations between stimulus-driven responses of pairs of neurons can itself be stimulus dependent. We examine how this dependence affects the information carried by neural populations about the stimuli that drive them. Stimulus-dependent changes in correlations can both carry information directly and modulate the information separately carried by the firing rates and variances. We use Fisher information to quantify these effects and show that, although stimulus-dependent correlations often carry little information directly, their modulatory effects on the overall information can be large. In particular, if the stimulus dependence is such that correlations increase with stimulus-induced firing rates, this can significantly enhance the information of the population when the structure of correlations is determined solely by the stimulus. However, in the presence of additional strong spatial decay of correlations, such stimulus dependence may have a negative impact. Opposite relationships hold when correlations decrease with firing rates.},

  abstract        = {Phasic neurons, which do not fire repetitively to steady depolarization, are found at various stages of the auditory system. Phasic neurons are commonly described as band-pass filters because they do not respond to low-frequency inputs even when the amplitude is large. However, we show that phasic neurons can encode low-frequency inputs when noise is present. With a low-threshold potassium current (I(KLT)), a phasic neuron model responds to rising and falling phases of a subthreshold low-frequency signal with white noise. When the white noise was low-pass filtered, the phasic model also responded to the signal's trough but still not to the peak. In contrast, a tonic neuron model fired mostly to the signal's peak. To test the model predictions, whole cell slice recordings were obtained in the medial (MSO) and lateral (LSO) superior olivary neurons in gerbil from postnatal day 10 (P10) to 22. The phasic MSO neurons with strong I(KLT), mostly from gerbils aged P17 or older, showed firing patterns consistent with the preceding predictions. Moreover, injecting a virtual I(KLT) into weak-phasic MSO and tonic LSO neurons with putative weak or no I(KLT) (from gerbils younger than P17) shifted the neural response from the signal's peak to the rising phase. These findings advance our knowledge about how noise gates the signal pathway and how phasic neurons encode slow envelopes of sounds with high-frequency carriers.},

In many cortices, including auditory cortex (ACx), interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons generate synchronous network gamma oscillations (30-70 Hz). Here, we show that differences in the connection patterns and synaptic properties of excitatory-inhibitory microcircuits permit the spatial extent of network inputs to modulate the magnitude of gamma oscillations. Simultaneous multiple whole-cell recordings from connected fast-spiking interneurons and pyramidal cells in L2/3 of mouse ACx slices revealed that for intersomatic distances <50 microm, most inhibitory connections occurred in reciprocally connected (RC) pairs; at greater distances, inhibitory connections were equally likely in RC and nonreciprocally connected (nRC) pairs. Furthermore, the GABA(B)-mediated inhibition in RC pairs was weaker than in nRC pairs. Simulations with a network model that incorporated these features showed strong, gamma band oscillations only when the network inputs were confined to a small area. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which oscillatory activity can be modulated by adjusting the spatial distribution of afferent input.},

It has been shown that divisive gain modulation of neural responses can result from a stochastic shunting from balanced (mixed excitation and inhibition) background activity. This gain control scheme was developed and explored with static inputs, where the membrane and spike train statistics were stationary in time. However, input statistics, such as the firing rates of pre-synaptic neurons, are often dynamic, varying on timescales comparable to typical membrane time constants. Using a population density approach for integrate-and-fire neurons with dynamic and temporally rich inputs, we find that the same fluctuation-induced divisive gain modulation is operative for dynamic inputs driving nonequilibrium responses. Moreover, the degree of divisive scaling of the dynamic response is quantitatively the same as the steady-state responses--thus, gain modulation via balanced conductance fluctuations generalizes in a straight-forward way to a dynamic setting.},

  abstract        = {Pyramidal cells of the apteronotid ELL have been shown to display a characteristic mechanism of burst discharge, which has been shown to play an important role in sensory coding. This form of bursting depends on a reciprocal dendro-somatic interaction, in which discharge of a somatic spike causes a dendritic spike, which in turn contributes a dendro-somatic current flow to create a depolarizing afterpotential (DAP) in the soma. We review here our recent work showing how the timing of this DAP influences the somatic firing dynamics, and how the degree of inactivation of dendritic Na(+) currents can cause an increased delay between somatic and dendritic spikes. This ultimately allows the DAP to become more effective at increasing the excitability of the somatic spike generating mechanism. Further, this delay between dendritic and somatic spiking can be regulated by strongly hyperpolarizing GABA(B) mediated dendritic inhibition, allowing the burst dynamics to fall under synaptic regulation. In contrast, a weaker, shunting inhibition due to GABA(A) mediated dendritic inhibition can regulate the dendritic spike waveform to decrease the dendro-somatic current flow and the resulting DAP. We therefore show that the qualitative behaviour of an individual cell can depend on the degree of synaptic input, and the exact timing of events across the spatial extent of the neuron. Thus, our results serve to illustrate the complex dynamics that can be observed in cells with significant dendritic arborisation, a nearly ubiquitous adaptation amongst principal neurons.},

A low-threshold potassium current, IKLT, present in many auditory brain stem structures and thought to enhance temporal encoding, facilitates spike selection of rapid input current transients through an associated dynamic gate. Whether the dynamic nature of IKLT interacts with the timescales in spectrally rich input to influence spike encoding remains unclear. We examine the general influence of IKLT on spike encoding of stochastic stimuli using a pattern classification analysis between spike responses from a ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) model containing IKLT, and the same model with the IKLT dynamics removed. The influence of IKLT on spike encoding depended on the spectral content of the current stimulus such that maximal IKLT influence occurred for stimuli with power concentrated at frequencies low enough (<500 Hz) to allow IKLT activation. Further, broadband stimuli significantly decreased the influence of IKLT on spike encoding, suggesting that broadband stimuli are not well suited for investigating the influence of some dynamic membrane nonlinearities. Finally, pattern classification on spike responses was performed for physiologically realistic conductance stimuli created from various sounds filtered through an auditory nerve (AN) model. Regardless of the sound, the synaptic input arriving at VCN had similar low-pass power spectra, which led to a large influence of IKLT on spike encoding, suggesting that the subthreshold dynamics of IKLT plays a significant role in shaping the response of real auditory brain stem neurons.},

We propose that gamma oscillations induce binomial-like spike-count statistics across noisy neural populations. Using simplified models of spiking neurons, we show how the discrimination of static signals based on the population spike-count response is improved with gamma induced binomial statistics. These results give an important mechanistic link between the neural correlates of attention and the discrimination tasks where attention is known to enhance performance. Further, they show how a rhythmicity of spike responses can enhance coding schemes that are not temporally sensitive.},

Pyramidal cells in the electrosensory lobe of the weakly electric fish, Apteronotus leptorhynchus, respond to dynamic broadband electrosensory stimuli with bursts and isolated spikes. In the present study, we mimic synaptic input during sensory stimulation by direct stimulation of electrosensory pyramidal cells with broadband current in vitro. The pyramidal cells respond to this stimulus with burst interspike intervals (ISIs) that are reliably and precisely correlated with the intensity of stimulus upstrokes. We found burst ISIs must differ by a minimum of 2 ms to discriminate, with low error, differences in stimulus intensity. Based on these results, we define and quantify a candidate interval code for the processing of sensory input. Finally, we demonstrate that interval coding is restricted to short ISIs such as those generated in burst events and that the proposed interval code is distinct from rate and timing codes.},

  abstract        = {We study a stochastic synchronization of spiking activity in feedforward networks of integrate-and-fire model neurons. A stochastic mean field analysis shows that synchronization occurs only when the network size is sufficiently small. This gives evidence that the dynamics, and hence processing, of finite size populations can be drastically different from that observed in the infinite size limit. Our results agree with experimentally observed synchrony in cortical networks, and further strengthen the link between synchrony and propagation in cortical systems.},
